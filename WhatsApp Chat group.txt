02/10/19, 3:54 pm - Saradindu: Not dat much extreme
02/10/19, 3:54 pm - Sambit Aus: Oh I can bet I did it in my dreams, that's not an issue
02/10/19, 3:54 pm - Saradindu: But somewhat close to dat
02/10/19, 3:55 pm - Saradindu: Some news nvr come into the real world but dey r happening
02/10/19, 3:55 pm - Sambit Aus: That was rhetorical
02/10/19, 3:55 pm - Saradindu: Recently a frnd of mine and his family had been asked to appear to the local police station...for questioning
02/10/19, 3:55 pm - Saradindu: Why
02/10/19, 3:56 pm - Saradindu: Coz his father is a editor of a local newspaper
02/10/19, 3:56 pm - Saradindu: And he was being suspected of doing jihaf
02/10/19, 3:56 pm - Sambit Aus: I hope that was rhetorical
02/10/19, 3:56 pm - Saradindu: Just coz they r Muslim
02/10/19, 3:57 pm - Saradindu: And also his father mentioned some of the key problems in his locality un his daily that the local bjp mp wasn't able to solve
02/10/19, 3:57 pm - Saradindu: I don't think so...
02/10/19, 3:58 pm - Saradindu: May be he asked really in a positive way...
02/10/19, 3:58 pm - Saradindu: U knw dictatorship is something we haven't yet reached...
02/10/19, 3:58 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Doesn't look faraway from your descriptions
02/10/19, 3:59 pm - Saradindu: So u r calling it dictatorship den?
02/10/19, 4:00 pm - Sambit Aus: I am
02/10/19, 4:02 pm - Saradindu: Well we don't knw i guess... modi's grand plan of 5 trillion dollar economy is now looking to be a far fetched dream fat the present gov can't deliver...i mean our economy is constantly going down...we r now no more the stable economy dat we once were...
02/10/19, 4:02 pm - Saradindu: We are going through a recession and yet no one wants to talk about dat...
02/10/19, 4:03 pm - Saradindu: All want to praise and hail modi for some stupid stuff he is doing
02/10/19, 4:03 pm - Saradindu: I don't know how much of democracy is left
02/10/19, 4:03 pm - Sambit Aus: While I agree with you on all the economic issues, but being a dictatorship is not related to that, not in this context.
02/10/19, 4:04 pm - Saradindu: Wen really everyone is becoming so blind...and hardly questioning any of the present govs policies
02/10/19, 4:05 pm - Saradindu: Yeah it is related...u see economy is one of the 1st signs of understanding a country's present method of rule
02/10/19, 4:05 pm - Saradindu: If u see 1930s Germany
02/10/19, 4:06 pm - Saradindu: The economy was booming...wen hitler rose to power in the initial years
02/10/19, 4:07 pm - Saradindu: And den he started investing heavily on military and infact he cut down the education budget to some extent just inorder to support his military cause
02/10/19, 4:07 pm - Sambit Aus: It does not prove causality, although yes it is a pretty good sign
02/10/19, 4:07 pm - Saradindu: And den he had his army...a potent looking one...but den the reality came into check
02/10/19, 4:07 pm - Saradindu: The economy failed drastically for Germany
02/10/19, 4:08 pm - Saradindu: Just before the start of the war
02/10/19, 4:08 pm - Saradindu: Dey could not afford a war...and Hitler was mad for it
02/10/19, 4:09 pm - Saradindu: Well our education budget has been cut short too...and also our military seems to be undergoing a heavy modernization
02/10/19, 4:09 pm - Saradindu: Not that i m complaining about the modernization thing
02/10/19, 4:09 pm - Saradindu: But education budget seriously!!
02/10/19, 4:10 pm - Saradindu: Casualty mustn't always has to be in blood and flesh always...
02/10/19, 4:10 pm - Saradindu: It starts at grassroots level and den widens...
02/10/19, 4:12 pm - Saradindu: I mean wat did my frnd and his family do wrong...just coz dey r Muslim and his father is a editor of a newspaper which isn't biased towards the gov...u can't just pick up anybody...and question dem...wat about tge humiliation dey r facing now from their neighbours
02/10/19, 4:12 pm - Saradindu: I will consider dat a casualty
02/10/19, 5:02 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Sambit meant "causality" not "casualty" 🤦🏻‍♂

01/01/20, 12:48 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: That depends on proofs
01/01/20, 12:49 am - Sambit Aus: Such as?
01/01/20, 12:50 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Proofs validating your statement. Cuz unlike my statement, yours is not an opinion but an attempt to establish a fact. So facts depend on proofs.

01/01/20, 10:28 am - Oli left

01/01/20, 10:41 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I'm sure it's because it's very new. This was taking the entire decade.
01/01/20, 10:42 pm - Sambit Aus: Most people dont particularly like dark
01/01/20, 10:42 pm - Sambit Aus: You should achieve it immediately
01/01/20, 10:43 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: They should put a separate dark category next time maybe
01/01/20, 10:44 pm - Sambit Aus: Then every genre would want its own thing
01/01/20, 10:45 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Hmm but they kinda made categories for Romance, SciFi, etc.
01/01/20, 10:45 pm - Sambit Aus: Proves my point
01/01/20, 10:46 pm - Sambit Aus: And the thing about 'dark' is that it is subjective
01/01/20, 10:46 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Right
01/01/20, 10:49 pm - Sambit Aus: @919051167186 have you seen fruits basket?
01/01/20, 11:01 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: .
01/01/20, 11:02 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: But i have heard it's good before as well

20/01/20, 12:05 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: For you
20/01/20, 12:05 pm - Sambit Aus: For what purpose?
20/01/20, 12:10 pm - Sambit Aus: It seems like it just happened to happen while he was playing so the media just decided by itself that that is causality because that narrative drives views
20/01/20, 12:19 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Or maybe it is causality indeed 🤷🏻‍♂
20/01/20, 12:19 pm - Sambit Aus: That "maybe" you used shows that it us baseless
20/01/20, 12:20 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Shows neither of us has any proof to disprove the others point
20/01/20, 12:29 pm - Sambit Aus: In the article as far as I can see it says, "suffered a brain stroke *while* in the middle of playing a PUBG match" there is no "because of" or similar terms to indicate causality. This is on purpose. They included the information that he was playing just to make it sound like it caused it even though they carefully avoided explicitly stating that because they know that its not true and must therefore avoid being held accountable for propagating that narrative. And the starting heading "PUBG Addiction" can just be added to anything that happens to someone while playing PUBG even if it has nothing to do with anything. I am sure this would still be labelled "PUBG addiction" even if someone sniped him while he was playing.

14/03/20, 6:57 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I didn't want it to be another faked box office record
14/03/20, 6:57 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Although all Disney box office records are probably faked to some degree
14/03/20, 6:58 pm - Sambit Aus: True
15/03/20, 2:18 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Anybody at Kalyani can meet me if they want

Atleast better than Disney buying their own tickets
18/03/20, 3:21 pm - Sambit Aus: Theares are shut that's why, otherwise Disney would have done it
18/03/20, 3:34 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: True
18/03/20, 4:56 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Now I'm re-evaluating weather I should physically meet Supratik when he comes back from Kolkata next week. 🤔
18/03/20, 5:37 pm - Sambit Aus: Teleconference
18/03/20, 5:55 pm - Supratik: I am not affected chill
18/03/20, 5:56 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Did you undergo thi CoViD test?
18/03/20, 5:56 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: *the
18/03/20, 5:56 pm - Supratik: I am not showing any Symptoms
18/03/20, 5:56 pm - Sambit Aus: Did you come in contact with someone?
18/03/20, 5:57 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: A carrier may not show any symptoms until 14 days
18/03/20, 5:57 pm - Sambit Aus: Or more
18/03/20, 5:58 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 14 days is the quarantine period assumed globally. So I'm fine as long as it is atleast 14 days.
18/03/20, 5:59 pm - Sambit Aus: ?
18/03/20, 6:00 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I'm pretty sure Supratik is not in quarantine...and he's not like us either who's daily life is anyway like quarantine...so pretty sure the answer is yes
18/03/20, 6:01 pm - Sambit Aus: Ummm how so?
18/03/20, 6:01 pm - Saradindu: 😂😂😂
18/03/20, 6:01 pm - Sambit Aus: There is only 1case in Kolkata right?
18/03/20, 6:02 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 1 person who supposedly met with many number of people in the 1 week he roamed freely despite warning from airport authorities to have a check
18/03/20, 6:04 pm - Sambit Aus: He came in on 15th so it cannot be 1week
18/03/20, 6:05 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 3/7 week... Apply ceil()
18/03/20, 6:05 pm - Sambit Aus: Why apply ceil?
18/03/20, 6:06 pm - Supratik: So basically you all niggas have assumed I have corona😂😂
18/03/20, 6:06 pm - Supratik: Besh besh tale thaki bari bosei
18/03/20, 6:06 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Cuz I can't say he roamed around for 0 weeks either. Since it's positive, and non zero the smallest I can say is 1
18/03/20, 6:07 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: We have put a probability that you have it
18/03/20, 6:07 pm - Sambit Aus: Why not use days
18/03/20, 6:08 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Why not use hours?
18/03/20, 6:08 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: minutes?
18/03/20, 6:08 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: seconds?
18/03/20, 6:08 pm - Sambit Aus: Yea why not?
18/03/20, 6:08 pm - Sambit Aus: Exactly?
18/03/20, 6:08 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Who knows?
18/03/20, 6:09 pm - Sambit Aus: You should, since you arw the one that didn't use any of them
18/03/20, 6:09 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: One doesn't need to know why not use something to use something else
18/03/20, 6:12 pm - Sambit Aus: That is valid if the person does not know how the other things work, in this case you knew the existence of days and hours, and how to use them and still chose not to, why? Almost seems like you wanted it to sound like more time than it actually was.

18/03/20, 10:27 pm - Saradindu: Not only that even a doctor's family in Krishnanagar in which the doctor is confirmed positive have been quarantined
18/03/20, 10:28 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Don't believe in rumours. Only believe in official information. Rule of thumb in situations of crisis.
18/03/20, 10:28 pm - Arunim Roy: preliminary testing involves doing x rays.. those are suspected cases, not confirmed cases.. Bro I'm in Bangalore.. We have 11 cases here.. I'd say we are a bit better informed

19/03/20, 10:32 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Why are you trying to make it from a pandemic to a universaldemic?
19/03/20, 10:34 am - Sambit Aus: Because then we can be part of an universe changing event
19/03/20, 10:34 am - Sambit Aus: Although Elon Musk will probably deny entry to mars
19/03/20, 10:55 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: He has to reach there first though
19/03/20, 10:56 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And he anyway believes corona panic is dumb
19/03/20, 11:00 am - Sambit Aus: Oh right, forgot about that, he is right tho
19/03/20, 11:00 am - Sambit Aus: I mean... Hasn't he already
19/03/20, 11:01 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: In the sense that "any panic is dumb"...Yes.
19/03/20, 11:01 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: He hasn't landed anything yet on Mars.
19/03/20, 11:02 am - Sambit Aus: No in the sense that this reaction to coronavirus is dumb
19/03/20, 11:03 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Maybe...maybe not 🤷🏻‍♂
19/03/20, 2:10 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: https://www-livemint-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.livemint.com/news/world/elon-musk-trashes-study-which-projects-millions-of-coronavirus-deaths-0-chance-says-tesla-ceo/amp-11584590310349.html?amp_js_v=a3&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQFKAGwASA%3D#referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livemint.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Felon-musk-trashes-study-which-projects-millions-of-coronavirus-deaths-0-chance-says-tesla-ceo-11584590310349.html
19/03/20, 2:29 pm - Sambit Aus: "the coronavirus panic is worse than the virus itself" absolutely true
19/03/20, 2:30 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Not yet I would say...but the way it is growing ( the panic), it could be
19/03/20, 2:34 pm - Sambit Aus: It is already, look at how many countries have closed their borders, India closed its borders to even indians. People are panic buying putting unnecessary stess on supply chains, and also drinking goumutra
19/03/20, 2:36 pm - Sambit Aus: And that is not even getting into the economic impact of it.
19/03/20, 2:38 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: If two weeks of such precautions can prevent a thousand deaths, worth it I'll say
19/03/20, 2:39 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Not the goumutra shit though
19/03/20, 2:39 pm - Sambit Aus: It has been going on for more than a month
19/03/20, 2:40 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: No it just started this week in India
19/03/20, 2:40 pm - Sambit Aus: Not talking specifically for India
19/03/20, 2:41 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Then I'll change weeks to months
And a thousand to tens of thousands
19/03/20, 2:44 pm - Sambit Aus: <Media omitted>
19/03/20, 2:46 pm - Sambit Aus: Less than 5% death rate
19/03/20, 2:47 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: That's the point. It's is preventing tens of thousands
19/03/20, 2:47 pm - Sambit Aus: Maximum of those who died are people with other conditions that already put them at risk regardless of the virus
19/03/20, 2:48 pm - Sambit Aus: The point is tens of thousands will not die even if we dont take such drastic measures
19/03/20, 2:49 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Still they could've lived much longer without the virus
19/03/20, 2:49 pm - Sambit Aus: In most cases no
19/03/20, 2:49 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: How can you say that?
19/03/20, 2:49 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Where are you getting this incorrect info?
19/03/20, 2:50 pm - Sambit Aus: They could probably have lived a few years more
19/03/20, 2:51 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes, those few could've been as large as 10 years
19/03/20, 2:51 pm - Sambit Aus: Because the virus is not deadly, its jusr infectious, thats it
19/03/20, 2:51 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Which is a lot to live
19/03/20, 2:51 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Better to take precautions than have half the world "sick" by this infectious virus
19/03/20, 2:52 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Death should not be the only concern
19/03/20, 2:52 pm - Sambit Aus: Seems to be for your argument
19/03/20, 2:53 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Is it also for your argument?
19/03/20, 2:53 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: That was just one aspect I was pointing out
19/03/20, 2:54 pm - Sambit Aus: If that is not the only concern then there are so many other concerns, what about people who depended on tourist for their monthly income, those people will starve to death then, you are just trading one off for the other.
19/03/20, 2:54 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Is the tradeoff that bad yet?
19/03/20, 2:55 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Do you have any statistics for that
19/03/20, 2:55 pm - Sambit Aus: We cannot save everyone anyway, this panic is just making life worse for a whole lot more people
19/03/20, 2:56 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Maybe or maybe not...unless you have a good study on it you can't say that
19/03/20, 2:57 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And we are not trying to save everything, just as many as we can
19/03/20, 3:02 pm - Sambit Aus: <Media omitted>
19/03/20, 3:03 pm - Sambit Aus: That too, per year, per country
19/03/20, 3:03 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Sure. Do it.
19/03/20, 3:04 pm - Sambit Aus: Ask thw local mla to introduce this in parliament
19/03/20, 3:04 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yup anybody taking the initiative will be appreciated
19/03/20, 3:05 pm - Sambit Aus: Why don't you take it? You seem to be keen on saving as many lives as possible
19/03/20, 3:06 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes and I'm doing that in one way
19/03/20, 3:06 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Why don't you do it the other way you proposed?
19/03/20, 3:06 pm - Sambit Aus: Do it in this way also, doesn't require mucg effort
19/03/20, 3:06 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Then you may do it as well
19/03/20, 3:06 pm - Sambit Aus: I am not keen on saving as many as possible
19/03/20, 3:07 pm - Sambit Aus: Which other way did I propose?
19/03/20, 3:07 pm - Saradindu: Seems u r disappointed sambo...
19/03/20, 3:07 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: The only way you proposed
19/03/20, 3:08 pm - Sambit Aus: Not at all
19/03/20, 3:08 pm - Sambit Aus: Which is?
19/03/20, 3:08 pm - Sambit Aus: You used "other" suggesting that I proposed more than 1 way
19/03/20, 3:09 pm - Saradindu: Man u r a hardliner
19/03/20, 3:10 pm - Sambit Aus: No no i agree with you, but then the car ban should also be implemented don't you think
19/03/20, 3:11 pm - Saradindu: People wid a lower immunity power are at most danger...coz obviously...and dat itself makes the virus deadly...coz people in India specifically are very low on immunity... especially in rural areas where their is still a category of people who do not get to eat properly so forget about developing a proper immune system
19/03/20, 3:12 pm - Saradindu: Car is not a virus sambo...wat r u saying...u can steer or simply control a car...drive it safely and be safe
19/03/20, 3:12 pm - Saradindu: But can u say the same about the virus...
19/03/20, 3:12 pm - Sambit Aus: Again I repeat I did not make the comment just for India
19/03/20, 3:13 pm - Saradindu: But our primary concern is india...
19/03/20, 3:13 pm - Sambit Aus: But people don't seem to do that tho
19/03/20, 3:13 pm - Sambit Aus: Not mine
19/03/20, 3:13 pm - Saradindu: The global economy is in a temporary shut down...true
19/03/20, 3:14 pm - Saradindu: But dat can't change the fact that people do need to take precautions
19/03/20, 3:14 pm - Sambit Aus: I never said that
19/03/20, 3:14 pm - Sambit Aus: Ofcourse take precautions
19/03/20, 3:14 pm - Saradindu: Yes I agree the kind of precaution ppl r taking is itself the coz of the economic shutdown
19/03/20, 3:15 pm - Saradindu: And taking precautions mean working from home, taking leaves, not going for work, buying stuff dat generally have a low demand
19/03/20, 3:15 pm - Saradindu: And all the above factors directly effect the economy of any country developed or no developed
19/03/20, 3:16 pm - Sambit Aus: No it doesn't
19/03/20, 3:16 pm - Saradindu: So u c the precautions ppl r taking is the coz of the shutdown of economy...so it can be said that precautions is a necessary evil in this case
19/03/20, 3:16 pm - Sambit Aus: Unnecessary evil
19/03/20, 3:17 pm - Saradindu: Wat do u suggest...ppl should go about doing dere daily jobs
19/03/20, 3:17 pm - Saradindu: No matter whether they come jn contact wid an infected person
19/03/20, 3:17 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes
19/03/20, 3:17 pm - Sambit Aus: No
19/03/20, 3:18 pm - Sambit Aus: Those two aee completely different things
19/03/20, 3:18 pm - Saradindu: And obviously a person is infected or not takes time to be discovered...so if dey go about doing dere work may be...dey can come in contact wid an infected person and just not know about it and den be a carrier demselves
19/03/20, 3:18 pm - Saradindu: And den dey pass it on to somebody
19/03/20, 3:19 pm - Saradindu: Are they??? How elaborate
19/03/20, 3:19 pm - Saradindu: Dere is a reason why the who has declared it to be pandemic
19/03/20, 3:19 pm - Supratik: Why are your " th " replaced by "d"
19/03/20, 3:20 pm - Saradindu: The word itself holds enough weight to take precautions
19/03/20, 3:20 pm - Saradindu: 😒
19/03/20, 3:20 pm - Supratik: 😒😒
19/03/20, 3:20 pm - Saradindu: 😒😒😒
19/03/20, 3:20 pm - Supratik: 😒😒😒😒
19/03/20, 3:21 pm - Saradindu: 😒😒😒😒😒
19/03/20, 3:21 pm - Supratik: 😒😒😒😒😒😒
19/03/20, 3:21 pm - Saradindu: 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
19/03/20, 3:22 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes because it has spread to the entire world, that is the definition of a pandemic
19/03/20, 3:22 pm - Sambit Aus: Stop
19/03/20, 3:22 pm - Saradindu: Yeah dats the reason ppl r taking precautions...so dat it doesn't spread more and become epidemic
19/03/20, 3:23 pm - Saradindu: 😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
19/03/20, 3:23 pm - Sambit Aus: 🤦🏻‍♂️ Koi samjhao ise abb
19/03/20, 3:24 pm - Supratik: Samaj gaya
19/03/20, 3:24 pm - Supratik: Khudse
19/03/20, 3:24 pm - Supratik: Aur wo nahi samjega tow kiya
19/03/20, 3:24 pm - Supratik: It's his choice
19/03/20, 3:25 pm - Saradindu: See taking precautions and panicking are 2 different things...and it is unfortunate that in india both are happening at the same time
19/03/20, 3:25 pm - Sambit Aus: "so that it doesn't spread more and become epidemic" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
19/03/20, 3:25 pm - Saradindu: Yeah funny
19/03/20, 3:25 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes
19/03/20, 3:25 pm - Saradindu: But u get it man ri8
19/03/20, 3:26 pm - Saradindu: Epidemic part is...I agree...😂😂😂😂
19/03/20, 3:26 pm - Sambit Aus: Agree, two are different, lets maintain that difference, which doesn't seem to be
19/03/20, 3:26 pm - Saradindu: But although it's not my creation...
19/03/20, 3:27 pm - Saradindu: It's supratik's
19/03/20, 3:27 pm - Sambit Aus: How?
19/03/20, 3:27 pm - Saradindu: Check dis u will knw
19/03/20, 3:28 pm - Sambit Aus: Oh ok people just created stages now
19/03/20, 3:28 pm - Saradindu: 😂😂😂😂
19/03/20, 3:28 pm - Saradindu: Yeah
19/03/20, 3:30 pm - Saradindu: How can u maintain the difference
19/03/20, 3:30 pm - Sambit Aus: But seriously i am worried about going on road after seeing the number of deaths due to road accidents
19/03/20, 3:30 pm - Saradindu: See may be on ur part u will maintain the distance
19/03/20, 3:30 pm - Sambit Aus: Why can't everyone do that?
19/03/20, 3:31 pm - Saradindu: Coz not everyone is well informed like u r...
19/03/20, 3:31 pm - Saradindu: Or may be dey r informed too much...
19/03/20, 3:31 pm - Saradindu: So either way it's not helping
19/03/20, 3:32 pm - Sambit Aus: Either way those people need to be fixed
19/03/20, 3:33 pm - Saradindu: In a country where population is already a growing concern and yet ppl want to have more and more kids...I don't understand how u want to fix "those people" anyways all the best mate
19/03/20, 3:33 pm - Saradindu: Dats why the regulation
19/03/20, 3:33 pm - Saradindu: Are coming into play
19/03/20, 3:33 pm - Saradindu: But I m not very hopeful dey will help much
19/03/20, 3:33 pm - Sambit Aus: Thats the government's job not mine
19/03/20, 3:34 pm - Saradindu: And the present government definitely doesn't want to fix "those people" coz during elections these are the people who vote blindly😂
19/03/20, 3:35 pm - Sambit Aus: Again, not my problem
19/03/20, 3:35 pm - Saradindu: I disagree
19/03/20, 3:35 pm - Sambit Aus: Sure you do
19/03/20, 3:35 pm - Saradindu: The government dat u chose if is not able to govern properly den dats definitely a problem...
19/03/20, 3:36 pm - Saradindu: But u can say dat u don't want to address dat problem...
19/03/20, 3:36 pm - Saradindu: Just like many others...I understand
19/03/20, 3:37 pm - Sambit Aus: My job is to vote, I vote, but if they are then incapable of doing the work then they should not have run of the seat in the first place
19/03/20, 3:37 pm - Saradindu: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
19/03/20, 3:38 pm - Saradindu: So u don't decide whether u r voting the ri8 person from ur constituency
19/03/20, 3:38 pm - Saradindu: Or u don't bother if the contestant is active capable enough
19/03/20, 3:38 pm - Saradindu: Actually*
19/03/20, 3:39 pm - Sambit Aus: Ofcourse I decide who I want there, but often that person is not chosen for tye job, in that case you cannot hold me accountable for thar
19/03/20, 3:39 pm - Saradindu: Whoever runs for the seat thinking dey r capable...u vote dem...
19/03/20, 3:40 pm - Sambit Aus: Them thinking they are capable is not enough
19/03/20, 3:40 pm - Saradindu: Do u vote for the PM or the MP from ur constituency?
19/03/20, 3:40 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes
19/03/20, 3:40 pm - Saradindu: Exactly
19/03/20, 3:40 pm - Saradindu: Wat yes
19/03/20, 3:40 pm - Sambit Aus: ??
19/03/20, 3:40 pm - Saradindu: Who do u vote for
19/03/20, 3:40 pm - Saradindu: The PM or the mp
19/03/20, 3:41 pm - Sambit Aus: Did you forget how elections work?
19/03/20, 3:41 pm - Saradindu: No I didn't
19/03/20, 3:41 pm - Saradindu: I just asked u a valid question
19/03/20, 3:41 pm - Saradindu: I vote for the mo
19/03/20, 3:41 pm - Saradindu: Mp
19/03/20, 3:41 pm - Saradindu: Not the pm
19/03/20, 3:41 pm - Sambit Aus: Ofcourse we cannot vote for the PM directly
19/03/20, 3:41 pm - Saradindu: Yes...
19/03/20, 3:41 pm - Sambit Aus: So????
19/03/20, 3:42 pm - Saradindu: So we have our answer...
19/03/20, 3:42 pm - Saradindu: Most of the MP's who stand for election
19/03/20, 3:42 pm - Saradindu: Have a background which is quite dirty
19/03/20, 3:42 pm - Saradindu: And dey just get votes coz of the pm candidate dey r representing
19/03/20, 3:42 pm - Sambit Aus: We had that answer before we started, you are not adding any value with that
19/03/20, 3:42 pm - Saradindu: Dats wat happens in india
19/03/20, 3:42 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Pandemic >>>> Epidemic. What do you mean here 😆
19/03/20, 3:43 pm - Saradindu: Ask supra...😂😂😂😂
19/03/20, 3:43 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: You said that
19/03/20, 3:43 pm - Saradindu: Supra said it first hand yesterday...no one noticed or wat...
19/03/20, 3:43 pm - Saradindu: Was I the only one
19/03/20, 3:44 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I ignore him you know
19/03/20, 3:44 pm - Saradindu: 😒
19/03/20, 3:44 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 🤣🤣🤣
19/03/20, 3:44 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Amar Jio ajke bondo kore dito oke believe kortam to
19/03/20, 3:45 pm - Saradindu: Amar to jio aaj o shokale bondo chilo
19/03/20, 3:45 pm - Sambit Aus: You just described the reality of the indian elections, excellent, good job, how does that relate to my point of it not being my job to fix those people it is their job
19/03/20, 3:45 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Ami akhun Jio tei chat korchi
19/03/20, 3:45 pm - Saradindu: Common yaar...look at the model of Delhi...
19/03/20, 3:46 pm - Saradindu: Aap did so much work in the last 5 years
19/03/20, 3:46 pm - Saradindu: Productive work
19/03/20, 3:46 pm - Saradindu: Dat it's showing
19/03/20, 3:46 pm - Sambit Aus: Just because supro did the mistake doesn't make it okay for you to do the same mistake, Infact it's worse, you repeated a mistake that you knew about
19/03/20, 3:46 pm - Saradindu: Dey changed "those people"
19/03/20, 3:46 pm - Saradindu: 😒
19/03/20, 3:46 pm - Sambit Aus: Again irrelevant information
19/03/20, 3:46 pm - Saradindu: Let me finish
19/03/20, 3:47 pm - Saradindu: Firstly if we r able to elect some gov like aap into power which could bring about that change den this entire fiasco could be fixed...
19/03/20, 3:47 pm - Saradindu: And obviously whose job it is elect dem...
19/03/20, 3:47 pm - Saradindu: Ours
19/03/20, 3:47 pm - Sambit Aus: Agreed, but we didn't
19/03/20, 3:48 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Drawing parallels, just because the car problem is being overlooked doesn't mean we should overlook the corona problem as well. In fact it is worse when you are well aware of it.
19/03/20, 3:48 pm - Saradindu: And so it's our problem
19/03/20, 3:49 pm - Saradindu: And we need to fix this problem
19/03/20, 3:49 pm - Sambit Aus: I never asked to overlook
19/03/20, 3:49 pm - Saradindu: Whether or not we overlook is simply the choice to make
19/03/20, 3:49 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Now play with the measurement of overlook
19/03/20, 3:50 pm - Saradindu: Which contituency did u vote from...if kalyani den did u check the manifesto of the politicians who contested from here...
19/03/20, 3:51 pm - Saradindu: If u did...den how could u decide on which party to vote for...coz I was clueless...coz none of dem gave wat we actually needed
19/03/20, 3:51 pm - Sambit Aus: How exactly am I supposed fix it? By voting? Then finding out that the guy I voted for is not the guy chosen? So how is it my responsibility if the guy I didn't choose doesn't do his job, i already told that he wouldn't.
19/03/20, 3:52 pm - Sambit Aus: Sure
19/03/20, 3:54 pm - Saradindu: So just bcoz ur guy didn't get elected so u shake it off as not ur problem...so how about dis...u r still a citizen of the country and not someone who is only supporting the opposition...
19/03/20, 3:54 pm - Saradindu: So definitely u have a duty
19/03/20, 3:54 pm - Saradindu: U could protest against the wrong that is happening
19/03/20, 3:54 pm - Sambit Aus: To do what exactly?

19/03/20, 3:55 pm - Sambit Aus: I am not patriotic
19/03/20, 3:55 pm - Sambit Aus: Neither am I pseudo patriotic
19/03/20, 3:56 pm - Saradindu: U knw I see ppl who want to protest on all types of social platform infront of ppl who don't matter on issues as trivial as ram mandir...
19/03/20, 3:57 pm - Saradindu: And wen the time comes to actually stand up for something dey go back
19/03/20, 3:57 pm - Saradindu: I guess...we don't have time to get involved at all
19/03/20, 3:57 pm - Sambit Aus: True, we don't, that's why we vote
19/03/20, 3:57 pm - Saradindu: True...but wat if we are being failed
19/03/20, 3:58 pm - Saradindu: We go about wid our daily life ..
19/03/20, 3:58 pm - Saradindu: Why am I even asking
19/03/20, 3:58 pm - Saradindu: Dats wat we do...😂😂😂
19/03/20, 3:58 pm - Saradindu: Dats wat we have always done
19/03/20, 3:58 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes, coz we dont have time to deal with the other stuff

19/03/20, 3:59 pm - Saradindu: And dese kind of mentality leads to problems like WW2 and the holocaust
19/03/20, 3:59 pm - Saradindu: I don't blame u... don't take me wrongly
19/03/20, 3:59 pm - Sambit Aus: So you say we should stop our daily life and sit on some road to protest?
19/03/20, 3:59 pm - Saradindu: I m just saying dis mentality is wrong...
19/03/20, 4:00 pm - Sambit Aus: What is your mentality
19/03/20, 4:00 pm - Saradindu: Same as urs...
19/03/20, 4:00 pm - Saradindu: I don't do it... neither do u...but ppl r dere who r actually trying
19/03/20, 4:01 pm - Sambit Aus: And is it changing anything?
19/03/20, 4:02 pm - Saradindu: Well aap came into power for the 2nd time...and kejriwal and most of his party workers are the ppl like u and me who got fed up...
19/03/20, 4:02 pm - Saradindu: And considering delhi is getting better in some aspects
19/03/20, 4:02 pm - Saradindu: I would say it is changing
19/03/20, 4:03 pm - Saradindu: I m not kejriwal supporter
19/03/20, 4:03 pm - Saradindu: I m supporting the work he did
19/03/20, 4:03 pm - Sambit Aus: Good
19/03/20, 4:04 pm - Sambit Aus: So what I gathered from this is that we need to be lucky and find a guy like kejriwal whose work is good
19/03/20, 4:05 pm - Sambit Aus: If we can't find anyone like that we are fucked
19/03/20, 4:05 pm - Saradindu: Or u could step up...we would love to see u as our next mp😂😂😂😂
19/03/20, 4:06 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: +1
19/03/20, 4:06 pm - Saradindu: U might do even better den modi😋
19/03/20, 4:06 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Might?
19/03/20, 4:06 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: You are insulting sambit
19/03/20, 4:06 pm - Saradindu: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
19/03/20, 4:07 pm - Sambit Aus: Well I could become a dictator as well, although I have not been rejected by art school...
19/03/20, 4:08 pm - Saradindu: Don't wry...even though Hitler was rejected by art scul...his work of fiction called the mein kempf was a croud favourite in that era
19/03/20, 4:09 pm - Sambit Aus: True true
19/03/20, 4:09 pm - Saradindu: A dictator like u won't be as bad as modi though...so am ok wid it
19/03/20, 4:09 pm - Sambit Aus: That's just because you know me personally.... Or do you 😈
19/03/20, 4:10 pm - Saradindu: Nah...I don't have to knw u if u will be calling urself a dictator

19/03/20, 4:19 pm - Sambit Aus: Shoot this guy
19/03/20, 4:27 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Digressing a bit: NSFW now stands for _Now Safe For Work_ as work is home now 🤣
19/03/20, 4:28 pm - Sambit Aus: Wait it hasn't been that all along 😱
19/03/20, 4:28 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: No sadly

19/03/20, 10:24 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: @918870549218 how's the scenario on Bangalore?
19/03/20, 10:24 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: "in
19/03/20, 10:24 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: **
19/03/20, 10:26 pm - Arunim Roy: 3 positive found today
19/03/20, 10:26 pm - Arunim Roy: 3 more to be correct
19/03/20, 10:27 pm - Arunim Roy: And.. apparently there was a girl near to my PG suspected of being infected.. she's been taken by airport authorities
19/03/20, 10:27 pm - Arunim Roy: But she's not on news which must mean she tested out negative
19/03/20, 10:27 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: What is your status? Working from home? Or work closed for now?
19/03/20, 10:27 pm - Arunim Roy: Working from home
19/03/20, 10:29 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Btw, Sunday self imposed Janta Curfew is going to be followed
19/03/20, 10:29 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: As said by our PM tonight
19/03/20, 10:29 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: All across India
19/03/20, 10:29 pm - Arunim Roy: Yeah.. saw the news.. don't know how much it'll be followed to the word

20/03/20, 9:37 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: That's pretty quick
20/03/20, 7:40 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Btw @61405887022 another critical point I would like to add regarding your argument on people depending upon tourists to earn (and similar probs), we must note that these are problems that are in our control. We can solve them immediately when and where we want. However of we not cautious enough about this virus, then the situation on future will not be in control. It's a long sighted decision to prioritise this uncontrolled problem over other problems that can be solved mich easily as they are in control.
20/03/20, 7:41 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: *if we are not cautious
20/03/20, 7:41 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: *in future
20/03/20, 7:42 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: <Media omitted>
20/03/20, 7:44 pm - Sambit Aus: Not sure what 'in control' means here
20/03/20, 8:18 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Means we can open the tourist spots anytime we want
20/03/20, 8:19 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: But we cannot stop the coronavirus spread anytime we want
20/03/20, 8:32 pm - Sambit Aus: Ok I will get back to you tomorrow, I am sleeping now
21/03/20, 5:12 am - Sambit Aus: Ummm.... Opening tourist spots is directly dependent on the progress of the virus which is not in control, by extention the tourist spots are also not in control logically, technically yes they are "in control" but practically not.

21/03/20, 9:11 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: @61405887022 Did you watch today's new DC chapter?! Another 500 chapter old plot becomes linked! Damn, this man had planned things so back in time!! XD
21/03/20, 9:12 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: A single DIALOGUE said almost 500 chapters back becomes such a key point of the main story!!  :O
21/03/20, 9:22 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: <Media omitted>
22/03/20, 7:32 am - Sambit Aus: Nice
22/03/20, 7:34 am - Sambit Aus: This didn't feel natural, it seems kind of forced tie in to me, like its not too believable that they figured it out from that memory that this kid was there who said the same thing so lets investigate. Seems farfetched.
22/03/20, 10:47 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Exactly 🤣🤣 They were like it just happened yesterday. And how immediate was their conclusion that this kid must have also been an aptx victim 😂😂. Way to conviniently shown!
22/03/20, 11:11 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: <Media omitted>
22/03/20, 11:12 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Almost 5k deaths since we talked (3 days ago)! That's more than 50% increase since then
22/03/20, 11:12 am - Souvik Jio: 😖
22/03/20, 4:35 pm - Sambit Aus: The rate is still less than 5% tho, it is well within expected. Also the rate of transmission seems to have increased after the lock downs were put in place, wierd isn't it.
22/03/20, 7:44 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: The infection must have spread before the lockdowns started in effect
22/03/20, 7:45 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And the spread will only get exponential if not taken serious measures
22/03/20, 7:49 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Also, 5 percent is a very high rate if it is allowed to spread easily to large number of people. 5% of 7B is 350 million, which would make it the deadliest pandemic in history ever recorded.
22/03/20, 7:51 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Even if it's only 3%, it's still 210 million, which still would break the record.
22/03/20, 7:54 pm - Sambit Aus: Umm I am not asking you to not stop the spread, but I am concerned about the things that are being done to do so. These steps according to me are unnecessary to this extent. The amount of disruption it is causing is avoidable is all I am saying
22/03/20, 7:57 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: _...according to me..._
Sure.
22/03/20, 9:20 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/patna-bihar-coronavirus-death-toll-in-india-1658377-2020-03-22
38 year old are dying now 😱
23/03/20, 1:49 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Toto/auto chol6 ajke Kalyani te?
23/03/20, 1:50 pm - Souvik Jio: Ha
23/03/20, 10:31 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: It took 40 days for India to reach 50 cases. But only 4 days for the next 50 and the last 100 cases have been reported in just 30 hours. Forget all the advanced graphs and jazzy illustrations: The Ro value of Corona is around 2, which means that a single infected person (on an average) can transfer this to 2 other people. It doesn't need a genius to figure out that 1 person can transfer this to 1000s of people, as already seen in South Korea (the multiplier effect). In short, this is not about the government or you doing it 80% right- even 1 mistake is enough to screw us. 
We can't wait for the numbers to increase- symptoms are visible only after 2-14 days. The cases coming out today must have gotten infected 4-5 days back. Number of people getting infected today would be way higher (the multiplier effect). India could have already entered the community spread stage.
Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy has warned that India could soon be dealing with a "tsunami" of cases, with the worst scenario implying *30Cr affected amongst which 40L would be severe. India has less than 1 Lakh ICU beds*- imagine what could be coming.
Our actions cannot be reaction-based, they have to be preemptive. One day surely won't suffice. The case study of Italy (27000+ cases, 2400+ deaths in last 7 days) should warn us enough.

27/03/20, 8:46 am - Sambit Aus: Italy has way too many deaths compared to other countries there is something else wrong there. South korea have total 9000 cases even without country wide lock downs, while Italy has 8000 deaths alone, that is unnatural. And their total population is comparable, so its not like the raw numbers are skewed. It just doesn't add up.

27/03/20, 7:46 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I don't know that, but I think they have come from a CoViD affected area, so they have been advised to be in quarantine

27/03/20, 8:05 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Cases on the first 7 days of lockdown were all infected before the lockdown
27/03/20, 8:05 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: So you can't know the effect of lockdown until atleast a week
27/03/20, 8:05 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: But the good news is the curve is getting more and more linear
27/03/20, 8:06 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: We are getting around 120 cases for the last 4 days

27/03/20, 10:56 pm - Supratik: Very grim news coming from head of Covid task force.  India has entered stage 3, it means it's everywhere, no way to contain or isolate. COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION IS AFOOT  
The next 10 days it incubates and explodes.
DONT GO OUT TO BUY ANYTHING, MANAGE WITH WHAT YOU HAVE FOR NEXT WEEK.  ITS BETTER TO THINK NOTHING IS AVAILABLE EXCEPT COVID.

BE CAREFUL.  THE COVID JOKE TIME IS OVER.

29/03/20, 12:07 pm - Arunim Roy: Yeah..
29/03/20, 3:30 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I have a question
29/03/20, 3:30 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: It is said that CoViD 19 has very low mortality rate...
29/03/20, 3:30 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Like only 2-3%
29/03/20, 3:31 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: But which statistics is showing this?
29/03/20, 3:37 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Anybody knows?
29/03/20, 4:07 pm - Souvik Jio: This was declared by WHO on 3rd march
29/03/20, 4:08 pm - Souvik Jio: But now mortality rate is close to 5%
29/03/20, 4:08 pm - Souvik Jio: As observed from stats
29/03/20, 4:23 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Which stats?
29/03/20, 4:24 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: The global stats I see gives around 18%
29/03/20, 4:32 pm - Sambit Aus: it depend on how you calculate it
29/03/20, 4:32 pm - Souvik Jio: Oita holo cases which have yielded results
29/03/20, 4:32 pm - Sambit Aus: https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/162/5/479/82647
29/03/20, 4:32 pm - Sambit Aus: exactly
29/03/20, 4:32 pm - Souvik Jio: Ami bolchi deaths/total no of cases
29/03/20, 4:33 pm - Sambit Aus: see this paper 4th paragraph it shows the two different ways of calculating it
29/03/20, 4:33 pm - Sambit Aus: the second way it is 18%
29/03/20, 4:34 pm - Sambit Aus: first way it is 5%
29/03/20, 4:36 pm - Sambit Aus: in this case second way of calculating is likely inaccurate because conditions in all countries are not proportional. not every country's people are likely to die. for example italy skews the number of deaths at lot. which is not the general trend. so calculating the second way is probably not suitable here
29/03/20, 4:38 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And the first way is also wrong
29/03/20, 4:38 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: It's including cases which hasn't even yielded any results
29/03/20, 4:40 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And why is this not wrong for the first case as well? Even the first case will be skewed by countries like Italy and USA who are hardly able to stop the spread of the infection
29/03/20, 4:41 pm - Sambit Aus: "The first estimator ignores the censoring that arises when patients remain ill in the hospital."
29/03/20, 4:42 pm - Sambit Aus: i am not saying first one is correct
29/03/20, 4:42 pm - Sambit Aus: its likely a better measure for generalizing
29/03/20, 4:44 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: It might be a more generalized meausure, but it's more incorrect by definition of mortality ratio
29/03/20, 4:46 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Or atleast, when we compare this CoViD with earlier diseases like SARS, we shouldn't use the current mortality stats for it. Cuz all SARS cases have been concluded, but vast majority CoViD cases are still unresolved.
29/03/20, 4:58 pm - Sambit Aus: agree with that but as said it is an estimator not a definite measure so you saying this is kind of redundant anyway
29/03/20, 5:02 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: The estimation could be waay off
29/03/20, 5:03 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Thats what I mean
29/03/20, 5:03 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 5% vs 18%
29/03/20, 5:03 pm - Sambit Aus: it could be quite accurate as well we wont know until it all ends, its all just speculation
29/03/20, 5:04 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Then we shouldn't do such speculations which have such uncertainty
29/03/20, 5:10 pm - Sambit Aus: we know from these numbers that the actual rate would end up somewhere between 5% and 18% atleast that much certainty we can have with a certain confidence from the numbers so far. maybe that gives some people hope which is good for their mental health, aslo we can plan for things knowing the estimates to know how much impact will be there when it all ends and prepare for that. so we definitely should speculate.
29/03/20, 5:11 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 5 to 18% is a huuge range
29/03/20, 5:12 pm - Sambit Aus: so?
29/03/20, 5:12 pm - Sambit Aus: its narrower than 100 and 0
29/03/20, 5:12 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 🤦🏻‍♂
29/03/20, 5:12 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Leave you don't get the point
29/03/20, 5:13 pm - Sambit Aus: if you could express your point perhaps i can understand
29/03/20, 5:13 pm - Sambit Aus: I see no benefits to not speculating
29/03/20, 5:18 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Ok Lemme try once more:
A common point for people who are trying to convince that CoViD doesn't have too much danger as it has a low mortality rate of 3-5% only, are basing their argument on a way uncertain measure. Cuz 3-5% is maybe low...but 18-20% will be huge. It'd mean one in every 5 CoViD patients are dying.
29/03/20, 5:19 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Some people make comments like these based on that 3-5% stat
29/03/20, 5:20 pm - Sambit Aus: they are not wrong, they have the data to make their case.
29/03/20, 5:21 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Which we just discussed is highly uncertain data with no guarantee of eventual correctness
29/03/20, 5:24 pm - Sambit Aus: neither does the opposing party have certain data to make a cliam that the speculation is wrong. We simply wont know who was right until it gets over. but if your point is we should stop speculating because people arguing are making certain claims based on data then, sorry its more important than the argument.
29/03/20, 5:24 pm - Souvik Jio: Yes that's incorrect
29/03/20, 5:26 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: The concluded data right now supports 18% and since eventually it'll be the concluded data that matters that's what we should look at
29/03/20, 5:26 pm - Sambit Aus: I already explained why that might not be the case
29/03/20, 5:26 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Also, can you list 1 country with 1000+ cases atleast that has a ratio of the second type less than even 10%?
29/03/20, 5:27 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes you only said the skewness because of different countries
29/03/20, 5:27 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Lets make a range then by using stats if individual countries
29/03/20, 5:27 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: *of
29/03/20, 5:28 pm - Sambit Aus: if you have that much free time sure go ahead I would love to see that.
29/03/20, 5:28 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I wonder what makes you so busy these days
29/03/20, 5:29 pm - Sambit Aus: Australia
29/03/20, 5:30 pm - Sambit Aus: Our universities and jobs are still open
29/03/20, 5:31 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Australia has 7%
29/03/20, 5:32 pm - Sambit Aus: yes, you asked less than 10% last time i checked 7 is less than 10
29/03/20, 5:32 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes very good you remember since last you check
29/03/20, 5:32 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Now let's map Australia to something like India
29/03/20, 5:33 pm - Sambit Aus: why exactly?
29/03/20, 5:33 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Cuz we have to solve India first before be can help others?
29/03/20, 5:34 pm - Sambit Aus: when did this become the point?
29/03/20, 5:34 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: When you said the data can only be contry specific, else it'll be skewed
29/03/20, 5:34 pm - Sambit Aus: why do we have to solve india first tho?
29/03/20, 5:34 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: So the country in our discussion should be India, if it's not obvious to you
29/03/20, 5:35 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: .
29/03/20, 5:35 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Also I stay in India
29/03/20, 5:35 pm - Sambit Aus: yes its not obvious, why india?
29/03/20, 5:35 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Nvm
29/03/20, 5:35 pm - Sambit Aus: thats a personal issue
29/03/20, 5:36 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Ok *we
29/03/20, 5:36 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And for your case, your family
29/03/20, 5:36 pm - Sambit Aus: .
29/03/20, 5:36 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And if you don't solve that personal issue you can't help others
29/03/20, 5:37 pm - Sambit Aus: no thats not really the case
29/03/20, 5:37 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: If you don't understand this then thats it!
29/03/20, 5:37 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: This discussion is useless
29/03/20, 5:37 pm - Sambit Aus: totally agree with you on that one

30/03/20, 7:06 am - Sambit Aus: According to official release only the first part is confirmed true so far.
30/03/20, 7:07 am - Sambit Aus: Which is not so much a spoiler because that you anyway knew that would happen
30/03/20, 11:58 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Why did you reply to your own reply? 🤔
30/03/20, 11:59 am - Sambit Aus: To express that it is a continuation of the first message
30/03/20, 12:00 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Ah I see...we couldn't have deduced that even though nobody interrupted you
30/03/20, 12:01 pm - Sambit Aus: I thought of the possibility that someone would interrupt me and took precautions
30/03/20, 12:01 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I see... you're taking precautions seriously now
30/03/20, 12:02 pm - Sambit Aus: Have always done so

04/04/20, 11:10 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Lol yeah 👆🏻
04/04/20, 11:12 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Anyway Arunim you can use the time to catch-up with some case closed eps

08/04/20, 10:07 am - Arunim Roy: Not good..gov thinks we have enough in stock...
08/04/20, 10:08 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Basically, they couldn't say no to Trump 🤷🏻‍♂️
08/04/20, 10:19 am - Souvik Jio: This had to be done after what Trump said. We don't have what it takes to take on China alone...we need the US beside us
08/04/20, 10:20 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Well then it is indeed politics. They shouldn't say "don't politicise the issue"
08/04/20, 11:07 am - Arunim Roy: Who said anything about taking on China alone? That's not our focus right now.. and we won't be the lone country to take on China after all this is over.. u think the US will let them be?
08/04/20, 11:55 am - Souvik Jio: Not because of covid 19
08/04/20, 11:55 am - Souvik Jio: I am talking general relationship
08/04/20, 11:57 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Keeping all politics aside, I feel it's a humanitarian gesture to supply medicines to the needy, and while it is arguable who the most needy is right now, US definitely looks like one of them.
08/04/20, 12:00 pm - Arunim Roy: India right now isn't in a position for doing philanthropy..with the increasing number of cases.. it'll take time for pharma companies to manage production within the stipulated time if things get worse..
08/04/20, 12:03 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes I agree with you... Let's hope India will be able to manage... Let's also hope US will be there when India will need help the most.
08/04/20, 12:11 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Btw @918870549218 where do you get the information that India doesn't have or can't produce enough hydroxychloroquine for its own needs?
08/04/20, 12:14 pm - Arunim Roy: I don't.. but I'm under the assumption that the days to come will be very hard on the country.. resources r limited as it is.. medical protective suits r not being given to doctors,.nor r masks.. I'm not too hopeful in such a scenario
08/04/20, 12:15 pm - Arunim Roy: Where we have enough drugs.. but let's see... Anyways even if there's a shortage.. I'm sure we won't know abt it
08/04/20, 12:20 pm - Sambit Aus: That last line explains the whole situation
08/04/20, 12:22 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And the second last line here contradicts that
08/04/20, 12:23 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: You are able to know there's a shortage of masks and protective suits because "medical protective suits r not being given to doctors,.nor r masks"
08/04/20, 12:27 pm - Arunim Roy: That's bcz of this very move that the government made.. what do u think will happen if a shortage does happen?? The onus will come upon administration y the drugs were shipped out in the first place...and they'll face a lot of flak.. but regarding masks that wasn't the case.. that's y we know
08/04/20, 12:28 pm - Arunim Roy: Anyways.. all this discussion should come abt if there is any shortage.. so till then us arguing about it is futile waste of time
08/04/20, 12:29 pm - Arunim Roy: I just hope there isn't a shortage
08/04/20, 12:29 pm - Arunim Roy: That's all
08/04/20, 12:44 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I meant if people are not getting chloroquine people will eventually know about it (since they are the ones not getting it). You won't be able to suppress such an important news for long, especially now that it is already under critical eye by several media.
08/04/20, 12:45 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes agreed. Let's hope for the best.

17/04/20, 9:04 pm - Arunim Roy: *The biggest danger is from the barbershop itself*.

 This danger will remain for a long time.
  *Barber rubs the nose of at least 4 to 5 people with a towel,*

The head of the US Department of Health J.  Anthony has said that 50 percent of the deaths in the US have happened in the same way that came in saloons.

If we come in contact with the infected patient, the ticket is sure to be cut.

We cannot even think of going to a salon and getting a haircut until the corona is completely over.

*Barber will be in contact with many people*

 Barber's towel, barber's razor barber brush, chair etc. are used by many people The threat will remain *even* after the situation returns to normal.

Be careful.

Your well wisher 🙏🏾🙏
17/04/20, 10:55 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: What a pun 🤣

19/04/20, 8:04 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Exactly 😂
19/04/20, 8:05 pm - Sambit Aus: It would be great if all ads on Disney+ are amazon ads lol
19/04/20, 8:05 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: That would've been on trending then 😝
19/04/20, 8:06 pm - Sambit Aus: Oh that would push more people to install Disney+ just to check it causing more profits to Disney, smart boi Bezos

26/04/20, 12:30 pm - Arunim Roy: Watched it last night
26/04/20, 12:31 pm - Arunim Roy: Action is really good.. I mean.. randeep hooda just made a mark for himself.. I liked him even more than Chris Hemsworth
26/04/20, 12:31 pm - Arunim Roy: But storyline is weak.. cliched.. and lot of loopholes in plot

02/05/20, 11:13 pm - Sambit Aus: <Media omitted>
02/05/20, 11:26 pm - Arunim Roy: This is really sad
04/05/20, 10:16 am - Saradindu: All the articles u shared are sad and depressing...
04/05/20, 10:17 am - Saradindu: But blaming everything on lockdown...I don't think that's justified!!!
04/05/20, 11:11 am - Sambit Aus: But they are a direct consequence of lockdown, why should I not blame it? 🤔
04/05/20, 12:34 pm - Saradindu: But the consequences u r mentioning...dey all were present before lockdown and will also be dere after it ends...so den what would blame?
04/05/20, 12:38 pm - Saradindu: Now if today someone is keeping money in dere house and the next day they get robbed...are those people are to blamed for that or the robbers?
04/05/20, 12:49 pm - Sambit Aus: They weren't as prevelent, they increased because of lockdown, because people lost their livelihoods both the cases mentioned here are direct consequence of the lockdown causing loss of job. And by following your analogy of robbers, the people who put the lockdown in place are the robbers here. They took away these peoples livelihood, they made a conscious decision that these lives matter less than the ones contracted with the virus. All I am asking is that is it worth trading these lives for those?
04/05/20, 12:51 pm - Sambit Aus: Specially because it has been shown that the virus can be stopped with significantly less disruption to everyone in countries like south korea.
04/05/20, 12:53 pm - Saradindu: South Korea's model will nvr work for counties like India where the medical facilities are not that very good and in most cases are not available...
04/05/20, 12:54 pm - Sambit Aus: So therefore it is correct to trade off some of those lives?
04/05/20, 12:54 pm - Saradindu: Secondly how is beating anybody justified...even if the person is going through a rough phase
04/05/20, 12:54 pm - Sambit Aus: Who ever said it is justified? I just said its a consequence of the lockdown.
04/05/20, 12:55 pm - Saradindu: Man...why are u blaming lockdown for some stupid psychopath's action
04/05/20, 12:56 pm - Saradindu: This is the only concern that the lockdown is directly responsible for
04/05/20, 12:56 pm - Sambit Aus: Because the psychopath wouldn't probably have become a psychopath if there was no lockdown
04/05/20, 12:56 pm - Saradindu: And forget Kenya...wat about the Indian labours of different state
04/05/20, 12:57 pm - Sambit Aus: So like mental health is of no importance?
04/05/20, 12:57 pm - Saradindu: A psychopath is always a psychopath
04/05/20, 12:57 pm - Sambit Aus: No, absolutely not.
04/05/20, 12:57 pm - Sambit Aus: There is almost always a tipping point
04/05/20, 12:58 pm - Saradindu: When did I say...I said if someone is feeling the urge to kill or assault just coz he/she is sitting ideal den dey should get help...
04/05/20, 12:58 pm - Saradindu: But blaming everything on lockdown is not a solution
04/05/20, 12:58 pm - Sambit Aus: People will act crazy if you put them in crazy situations
04/05/20, 12:58 pm - Saradindu: Atleast u should understand that
04/05/20, 12:59 pm - Saradindu: Just visit a shrink before the tipping point comes
04/05/20, 12:59 pm - Saradindu: Ppl won't do dat coz dey they it's a taboo
04/05/20, 12:59 pm - Sambit Aus: I am not looking for a solution, i am just asking if it is worth the trade off of lives
04/05/20, 1:00 pm - Sambit Aus: Easier said than done
04/05/20, 1:00 pm - Saradindu: Ok to answer this...and my answer is totally based on the 3rd article u shared...and also on the condition of our ppl who are wage workers...
No it's not ri8 to trade their lives
04/05/20, 1:00 pm - Saradindu: Wat nonsense
04/05/20, 1:01 pm - Saradindu: U r ill
04/05/20, 1:01 pm - Saradindu: And u won't go to a doctor who could help u...
04/05/20, 1:01 pm - Sambit Aus: How would you tell if someone is about to tip?
04/05/20, 1:01 pm - Saradindu: Wats the hard thing in this
04/05/20, 1:02 pm - Saradindu: Well there is a process...if u want I could recommend u some books from different therapist around the worl
04/05/20, 1:02 pm - Saradindu: Dat could help u understand wats the tipping point or wat r the symptoms
04/05/20, 1:02 pm - Sambit Aus: Yea yea yea, go tell that to a person about to tip off
04/05/20, 1:03 pm - Saradindu: I have had first hand experience of it so atleast stop this bullshit will u
04/05/20, 1:04 pm - Sambit Aus: And I think that you are assuming every mental health patient is responsible enough to self diagnos
04/05/20, 1:04 pm - Saradindu: I had known a person who has been going through a clinical depression from a long time and now that person is well and good after completion of her treatment
04/05/20, 1:04 pm - Saradindu: Den whose fault is it???
04/05/20, 1:07 pm - Sambit Aus: Let me take this particular example and explain, in this case the man killed his family because of stress caused due to cash crunch, which was caused due to loss of livelihood, which was caused by lockdowns.
04/05/20, 1:08 pm - Saradindu: U think this thing in his head was going on for a month or so
04/05/20, 1:08 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes.
04/05/20, 1:08 pm - Saradindu: 😂
04/05/20, 1:08 pm - Saradindu: U should have some knowledge before u say such things
04/05/20, 1:08 pm - Sambit Aus: Thats what the police said
04/05/20, 1:08 pm - Saradindu: Ok
04/05/20, 1:08 pm - Saradindu: Let's discuss the person 1st
04/05/20, 1:09 pm - Sambit Aus: Did you know that person personally?
04/05/20, 1:09 pm - Sambit Aus: If not then your guess is as good as mine
04/05/20, 1:10 pm - Saradindu: No I don't have to...I have read many authentic reports about such cases
04/05/20, 1:10 pm - Sambit Aus: 'such cases' and this case is different
04/05/20, 1:10 pm - Saradindu: Don't run into conclusions already let me finish
04/05/20, 1:12 pm - Sambit Aus: And even if he was suffering from a long time, this caused the tipping point, which could have been avoided if there was no lockdown, and maybe that would have given more time to cure him and therefore these lives wouldn't have been lost.
04/05/20, 1:13 pm - Saradindu: Ok grt u did half my explanation
04/05/20, 1:13 pm - Saradindu: Now coming to ur theory...
04/05/20, 1:14 pm - Saradindu: If he would have seen the doctor before...den itself...most of it could be solved...
04/05/20, 1:14 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes, perhaps
04/05/20, 1:14 pm - Sambit Aus: But that wasn't the case
04/05/20, 1:14 pm - Saradindu: And why wasn't it the case
04/05/20, 1:15 pm - Saradindu: Bcoz often we humans neglect signs
04/05/20, 1:16 pm - Saradindu: I m sure he was having a hard time running his family...and this urge to kill was dere from before...but since he thot that these are just negative thots and everyone faces such troubles...
04/05/20, 1:16 pm - Saradindu: So he just ignored it and avoided going to a shrink
04/05/20, 1:16 pm - Saradindu: So whose fault it was at the end of the day
04/05/20, 1:17 pm - Sambit Aus: How are you do sure tho? 🤔
04/05/20, 1:17 pm - Sambit Aus: Lockdown's, because it caused the tipping point
04/05/20, 1:18 pm - Sambit Aus: He wasn't killing people before
04/05/20, 1:18 pm - Sambit Aus: He killed because the lockdown pushed him over
04/05/20, 1:19 pm - Saradindu: So he should have just visited the shrink...wen he felt his urge of killing getting stronger
04/05/20, 1:19 pm - Sambit Aus: .
04/05/20, 1:20 pm - Saradindu: So u just wanted to find a single villain in the whole story and that villain here u found was lockdown?
04/05/20, 1:21 pm - Sambit Aus: No don't want to find villians, i want to find which lives people are willing to trade off
04/05/20, 1:22 pm - Saradindu: In this killing story... lockdown was responsible for the tripping...but situation leading to tripping was created much much before lockdown were in place
04/05/20, 1:23 pm - Saradindu: So u see there is no single villain...
04/05/20, 1:23 pm - Saradindu: About the lives dey r willing to trade
04/05/20, 1:23 pm - Sambit Aus: So you do agree that without lockdown there was a higher chance of those lives being saved?
04/05/20, 1:24 pm - Saradindu: Nope
04/05/20, 1:24 pm - Sambit Aus: So those lives were already forfeit
04/05/20, 1:24 pm - Saradindu: Dere were 50-50 chances
04/05/20, 1:25 pm - Saradindu: See i can't speak for any government
04/05/20, 1:26 pm - Saradindu: But I knw one thing for sure...that lockdown is causing harm and good at the same time...
04/05/20, 1:26 pm - Saradindu: And yes government leaders around the world are trading lives sitting in their offices
04/05/20, 1:26 pm - Sambit Aus: I agree, but how much harm are we willing to trade off
04/05/20, 1:27 pm - Saradindu: But the killings... that's not a direct consequence of lockdown...
04/05/20, 1:27 pm - Saradindu: I don't think there are any prefixed numbers for that
04/05/20, 1:27 pm - Saradindu: Or any category
04/05/20, 1:28 pm - Sambit Aus: Okay by your definition they are indirect, fine, but it still did cause it.
04/05/20, 1:28 pm - Saradindu: It will be more like collateral damage
04/05/20, 1:28 pm - Saradindu: Well yes...but no entirely
04/05/20, 1:29 pm - Sambit Aus: Good enough for my argument
04/05/20, 1:29 pm - Saradindu: Wat u r trying to say is that the lockdown caused it and we are trading lives by implementing lockdowns in various countries
04/05/20, 1:29 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes
04/05/20, 1:29 pm - Saradindu: Which isn't correct
04/05/20, 1:29 pm - Saradindu: Dis isn't a debate
04/05/20, 1:29 pm - Sambit Aus: When we know that it can be avoided
04/05/20, 1:29 pm - Sambit Aus: Isn't it?
04/05/20, 1:30 pm - Sambit Aus: You just agreed to it
04/05/20, 1:30 pm - Saradindu: Often wen u r debating...u always try to be in one shoe and forget the other person
04/05/20, 1:30 pm - Sambit Aus: Ok gramar nazi
04/05/20, 1:30 pm - Saradindu: Step into the other person's shoe and try to understand the other person
04/05/20, 1:31 pm - Saradindu: Seriously???
04/05/20, 1:31 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes?
04/05/20, 1:31 pm - Saradindu: U knw as u said understand the other person's misery
04/05/20, 1:31 pm - Saradindu: Don't just try to find a villain
04/05/20, 1:32 pm - Saradindu: Coz dere is nvr a single villain in any story
04/05/20, 1:32 pm - Saradindu: Dis isn't movie... it's life
04/05/20, 1:32 pm - Sambit Aus: I am not trying to find the villian, i just want to find at what point we stop trading off
04/05/20, 1:32 pm - Saradindu: Here we have factors and situation leading to other situations which eventually ruin us
04/05/20, 1:33 pm - Saradindu: In that man's case...dis is exactly wat happened
04/05/20, 1:33 pm - Saradindu: He was losing even before the lockdown stated...address that first of all
04/05/20, 1:33 pm - Saradindu: His mind*
04/05/20, 1:34 pm - Sambit Aus: You are entirely assuming that
04/05/20, 1:34 pm - Saradindu: No m not...u only said the lockdown was the tripping point
04/05/20, 1:35 pm - Saradindu: So obviously it was in place much much before
04/05/20, 1:35 pm - Saradindu: Dat
04/05/20, 1:35 pm - Saradindu: And dat is usually wat happens
04/05/20, 1:35 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes considering your assumption is true of course
04/05/20, 1:35 pm - Saradindu: Our mind doesn't work like dat
04/05/20, 1:35 pm - Saradindu: It's not that all of sudden we will trip
04/05/20, 1:35 pm - Saradindu: It will give u symptoms
04/05/20, 1:36 pm - Sambit Aus: Not necessarily, we don't know what the situation was and anything we say is assumption, that's why l went with what the police concluded
04/05/20, 1:36 pm - Saradindu: But if u overlook those symptoms then situations can lead to such disasters
04/05/20, 1:37 pm - Saradindu: See as I told u...u have first read similar case histories
04/05/20, 1:37 pm - Saradindu: Read into some accounts
04/05/20, 1:37 pm - Sambit Aus: Why?
04/05/20, 1:37 pm - Saradindu: U will knw wat I m trying to point out
04/05/20, 1:38 pm - Sambit Aus: This case may be different, how are you so sure that it is similar to other cases?
04/05/20, 1:38 pm - Saradindu: So dat we can be on the same page and den have the discussion
04/05/20, 1:38 pm - Sambit Aus: We are having the discussion
04/05/20, 1:39 pm - Sambit Aus: With your assumptions, so we are in same page
04/05/20, 1:39 pm - Saradindu: I wish we were
04/05/20, 1:39 pm - Sambit Aus: But you have to acknowledge that its still your assumption and not proven fact
04/05/20, 1:40 pm - Saradindu: Yes it is...
04/05/20, 1:40 pm - Sambit Aus: Show me the proof then
04/05/20, 1:41 pm - Sambit Aus: Coz whatever you said wasn't in the article
04/05/20, 1:42 pm - Saradindu: I can't show u any proof
04/05/20, 1:42 pm - Saradindu: I can't give u any of dat
04/05/20, 1:42 pm - Sambit Aus: Because there is none
04/05/20, 1:42 pm - Sambit Aus: So it is assumption
04/05/20, 1:42 pm - Sambit Aus: A sound assumption I agree, but still an assumption nonetheless
04/05/20, 1:42 pm - Saradindu: And ur believing that lockdown is entirely responsible for is based on facts
04/05/20, 1:43 pm - Saradindu: Can u show me a proof which says that his mental health was fine before lockdown
04/05/20, 1:43 pm - Sambit Aus: For the loss of lives yes.
04/05/20, 1:44 pm - Sambit Aus: I dont need to to prove my point, he was stressed because of cash crunch due to lockdown. That's all I need to prove my point
04/05/20, 1:45 pm - Saradindu: Ok if it was ur way...den would u lift the lockdowns?
04/05/20, 1:45 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes
04/05/20, 1:46 pm - Sambit Aus: Not entirely, but significantly
04/05/20, 1:46 pm - Saradindu: And if den ppl die den coz of the spread...
04/05/20, 1:46 pm - Saradindu: Den r u willing to trade their lives
04/05/20, 1:47 pm - Saradindu: I this case lakhs of death
04/05/20, 1:47 pm - Saradindu: In*
04/05/20, 1:48 pm - Sambit Aus: I would put measures that worked in south korea and then do it
04/05/20, 1:48 pm - Saradindu: In South Korea they had infrastructure that could support that model
04/05/20, 1:48 pm - Saradindu: We don't have such an infrastructure
04/05/20, 1:49 pm - Saradindu: And if u were planning of building such infrastructure den it would take atleast a year
04/05/20, 1:49 pm - Sambit Aus: Oh wait I am not talking about just India
04/05/20, 1:49 pm - Saradindu: With the full work force also
04/05/20, 1:49 pm - Saradindu: Ok let's talk about usa
04/05/20, 1:49 pm - Saradindu: Dey have the infra
04/05/20, 1:49 pm - Saradindu: As well as man nd money
04/05/20, 1:49 pm - Saradindu: Power
04/05/20, 1:49 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes definitely they should
04/05/20, 1:50 pm - Saradindu: U knw ri8 inspite of the lockdown in place usa has recorded most number of cases and deaths
04/05/20, 1:50 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes
04/05/20, 1:51 pm - Saradindu: How r u proposing South Korean model wouldn't have failed
04/05/20, 1:51 pm - Saradindu: In the 3rd most populous country
04/05/20, 1:51 pm - Saradindu: Ok I have got some work...will carry forward that discussion after the works done...sry to take leave...but it's urget
04/05/20, 1:52 pm - Sambit Aus: Because of the fact that it worked for south korea
04/05/20, 1:53 pm - Sambit Aus: Ideally this should have been done well before tho, that would have been exponentially better
04/05/20, 1:59 pm - Sambit Aus: Also Australia kind of did the same thing and it worked, although there were significantly more lockdown measures than south korea, but public transport was on, people could travel to work if needed, resturants were open with takeaway only, jogging with family was allowed, visitors to your house were even allowed in limited numbers. Interstate travel was allowed with 14 day quarantine period, even domestic flights were on. So with two countries making it work, why can't others?
04/05/20, 2:06 pm - Saradindu: Can u plz mention the testing policies adopted by these countries?
04/05/20, 2:07 pm - Saradindu: And also the population?

29/06/20, 9:50 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: He didn't lie. He, being the omniscient he is, must have just confused the time period he was in. He must have forgotten that the mere mortals he was talking to were still in the past, whereas he was sharing the knowledge from the future.
29/06/20, 10:15 am - Arunim Roy: Happy birthday Sara..

08/09/20, 7:07 pm - Sambit Aus: Is time flowing in reverse for you?
08/09/20, 7:08 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Who knows..m it might be going reverse for you
08/09/20, 7:08 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: After all... "reverse" is relative
08/09/20, 7:09 pm - Sambit Aus: Well the measurement is counting upwards for me and that is what we can use as reference for "forward" flow
08/09/20, 7:10 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: upwards.... forward.... More relative stuffs
08/09/20, 7:10 pm - Sambit Aus: Numbers have definite order they are by definition not reletive
08/09/20, 7:11 pm - Sambit Aus: Which makes them the most reletive things but you get my point
08/09/20, 7:12 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yeah I'm the omniscient being who gets everyone's points... 😏
08/09/20, 7:13 pm - Sambit Aus: 😛 Sounds gay but thats ok
08/09/20, 7:15 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Sounds asexual to me...

09/09/20, 8:46 am - Arunim Roy: Naruto Shippuden is wrong on so many levels but "forgiveness" is something that stands out.. I'm not giving spoilers.. but the leaf's attitude towards cloud village is least to say, lax
09/09/20, 8:48 am - Arunim Roy: And with regards to forgiveness, Datta and Sambit know.. how impractical things get later on..
Makes me cringe

12/09/20, 5:49 pm - Arunim Roy: @61405887022 kengen asura anime cgi is just like that of berserk(new).. saw the trailer.. u think it's worth the watch?
12/09/20, 5:50 pm - Sambit Aus: Trust me
12/09/20, 5:51 pm - Arunim Roy: Okay..I thought the name u gave was of just one anime
12/09/20, 5:51 pm - Arunim Roy: 😄
12/09/20, 5:51 pm - Sambit Aus: Oh yea probably should have cleared that out 😅
12/09/20, 5:52 pm - Arunim Roy: Dub or Sub?
12/09/20, 5:52 pm - Sambit Aus: I mean whatever you prefer really
12/09/20, 5:52 pm - Sambit Aus: I prefer sub
12/09/20, 5:53 pm - Arunim Roy: Erased and attack on Titan dub is better
12/09/20, 5:53 pm - Arunim Roy: Naruto I prefer dub
12/09/20, 5:54 pm - Sambit Aus: Erased I watched sub attack on titans dub is better yes
12/09/20, 5:54 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Erased in sub please... The original voices make so much difference 🥺
12/09/20, 5:55 pm - Sambit Aus: And both these i only watched sub so don't know
12/09/20, 5:56 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: The only two things I prefer in dub are Cowboy Bebop and Dragon Ball <anything>

12/09/20, 5:56 pm - Arunim Roy: Oh yeah Black clover definitely dub.. can't stand the sub😂
12/09/20, 5:56 pm - Arunim Roy: How's cowboy Bebop? I've heard it's good
12/09/20, 5:57 pm - Sambit Aus: Oh boy
12/09/20, 5:57 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Maybe because the first time I watched the sub, I'm getting biased, but the emotions of the anime resonated more with me with the Japanese voices
12/09/20, 5:57 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: It's good. One of the classics. But it's a one episode one story thing. So be warned.
12/09/20, 5:58 pm - Arunim Roy: I hate that kind
12/09/20, 5:58 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yeah that's something that you either hate or love. There's no in between 😂
12/09/20, 5:58 pm - Sambit Aus: Watch trigun
12/09/20, 5:59 pm - Arunim Roy: Watch Monster dubbed

22/09/20, 11:36 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Oh okay
22/09/20, 11:36 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Did all of you test yourselves as well?
22/09/20, 11:36 pm - Saradindu: We have been instructed to not go out...
22/09/20, 11:37 pm - Saradindu: So I had asked the Apollo diagnostic center to collect sample from home
22/09/20, 11:37 pm - Saradindu: But apparently they don't operate here at the moment

22/09/20, 11:40 pm - Saradindu: Yes...
22/09/20, 11:40 pm - Saradindu: It started with my jhethu
22/09/20, 11:40 pm - Saradindu: He works at the hospital
22/09/20, 11:41 pm - Saradindu: And had served in the covid hospital in kalyani
22/09/20, 11:41 pm - Saradindu: After his service of 8 days was over he was sent into quarantine of 14 days
22/09/20, 11:42 pm - Saradindu: And he was tested negative while leaving quarantine
22/09/20, 11:42 pm - Saradindu: But after he got back home he started showing symptoms
22/09/20, 11:42 pm - Souvik Jio: Oh bhai! Ei sob toh jani na😶😶😶

26/09/20, 1:23 pm - Sambit Aus: Ami achi discord e
27/09/20, 5:16 pm - Sambit Aus: <Media omitted>
27/09/20, 5:16 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I was just reading the same
27/09/20, 5:17 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And remembering our days with cityville
27/09/20, 5:17 pm - Sambit Aus: 🙁
27/09/20, 5:17 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I can't believe they didn't upgrade from flash after all these years 🤦🏻‍♂️
27/09/20, 5:18 pm - Sambit Aus: True
27/09/20, 5:18 pm - Sambit Aus: But what is flash alternative now?
27/09/20, 5:18 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: WebAssembly
27/09/20, 5:19 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: It basically allows you to write C and C++ code in browser
27/09/20, 5:19 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: This is slightly oversimplification, but more or less yes
27/09/20, 5:20 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: You remember Pixlr? They were using flash when we used them back in class 10 for our Rasengan editings
27/09/20, 5:20 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: But now they have upgraded and they use WebAssembly
27/09/20, 5:20 pm - Sambit Aus: Oh ok
27/09/20, 5:21 pm - Sambit Aus: But flash was much easier to use i guess
27/09/20, 5:21 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes definitely, and that's why all the security issues popped up
27/09/20, 5:22 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: But better support for web assembly is building, it's pretty new now but gonna be pretty big in the next 5 years or so
27/09/20, 5:23 pm - Sambit Aus: And the solution to that was "oh yea we need this 50year old pseudo-assembly level language on the application layer of the web"?
27/09/20, 5:26 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Web assembly is like an assembly language for the web, you don't have to use C or C++, you can use any language that compiles to assembly outside the browser.
27/09/20, 5:26 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: For example, I prefer using Rust when writing WebAssembly
27/09/20, 5:26 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: It supports C++, doesn't have to be only C++
27/09/20, 5:27 pm - Sambit Aus: Oh that makes a little more sense
27/09/20, 5:27 pm - Sambit Aus: But all of the gui features from flash are gone right?
27/09/20, 5:28 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: You can create GUI stuff with C++
27/09/20, 5:28 pm - Sambit Aus: Eww
27/09/20, 5:28 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: All the COD and games were made in that, weren't they?
27/09/20, 5:29 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: One just needs to create a framework over that language that makes it easier to use as it was with flash
27/09/20, 5:29 pm - Sambit Aus: I am not worried about those, i am worried about the flash mini game things
27/09/20, 5:30 pm - Sambit Aus: "needs to create" is the issue
27/09/20, 5:30 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I run them with my flash wrapper written in rust
27/09/20, 5:30 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: It will soon be created there are open source communities working in them
27/09/20, 5:31 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I have a bunch of old flash games that I use my rust wrapper to still play them
27/09/20, 5:31 pm - Sambit Aus: Hmmm.... Need to do it first hand to understand
27/09/20, 5:32 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yeah it's pretty new (probably introduced in 2018), I myself am pretty noob at it
27/09/20, 5:32 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: But I know it's the alternative to flash and can do much more than that
27/09/20, 5:33 pm - Sambit Aus: Lol it took uoto 2018 to come up with a better flash
27/09/20, 5:33 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 😂
27/09/20, 5:34 pm - Sambit Aus: And the answer was to stick a fucking assembly level language in there, geniuses
27/09/20, 5:34 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 😅😆
27/09/20, 5:35 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: But I'm impressed Pixlr made a whole Photoshop clone in WebAssembly so soon. So I see potential.
27/09/20, 5:42 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Anyways, keo khelbe?
27/09/20, 7:20 pm - Sambit Aus: Yes
27/09/20, 7:50 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Let's play then

28/09/20, 9:20 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Nobody cares timezones 🤷🏻‍♂️
28/09/20, 9:21 pm - Sambit Aus: Nope
28/09/20, 9:22 pm - Sambit Aus: Time is just a human construct, its abstract
28/09/20, 9:32 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: So are birthdays 🤷🏻‍♂️
28/09/20, 9:35 pm - Sambit Aus: You do actually take birth tho
28/09/20, 9:35 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes but "days"....
28/09/20, 9:36 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: You should wish the birth-moment then
28/09/20, 9:36 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Which doesn't repeat, because "year" is also a human construct
28/09/20, 9:37 pm - Sambit Aus: Ok souvik, toke wish kora hobena because Datta logical kotha bolche
28/09/20, 9:37 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 🤣🤣
28/09/20, 9:38 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Only you can't wish, for us, time is as real as birthdays
28/09/20, 9:39 pm - Sambit Aus: Why discrimination
28/09/20, 9:39 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Because you believe in this
28/09/20, 9:40 pm - Sambit Aus: But it is.
28/09/20, 9:40 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: You don't need something to be true to believe in it
28/09/20, 9:41 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Else religions wouldn't have existed
28/09/20, 9:41 pm - Sambit Aus: Just because it exists doesn't mean its real
28/09/20, 9:42 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Good luck convincing this to the believers
28/09/20, 9:55 pm - Supratik: Khelte ai

29/09/20, 12:39 pm - Sambit Aus: Lol
29/09/20, 1:10 pm - Saradindu: The emoji wasn't showing up wen I texted...I mean it was showing as "?"
29/09/20, 1:11 pm - Saradindu: So I thought I wasn't delivered properly...
29/09/20, 1:11 pm - Saradindu: I m facing this issue multiple times...
29/09/20, 1:13 pm - Saradindu: The other person keeps complaining that they were not able to see the emoji I sent which usually happens wen on my phone I get those "?" Marks instead of the actual emoji
29/09/20, 1:14 pm - Saradindu: I m facing this issue after having installed the latest  update on my phone...so I guess it has something to do wid the ui
29/09/20, 1:15 pm - Saradindu: So I deleted it and then didn't bother sending the same emoji
29/09/20, 1:17 pm - Sambit Aus: @917980062607 Happy birthday again 🥳

23/10/20, 2:56 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I see... Even bigger fall
23/10/20, 2:56 pm - Supratik: And these are just theories stupid ones🤣
23/10/20, 2:57 pm - Supratik: But the one exciting me is the final form of Naruto in boruto
23/10/20, 2:57 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: What do you mean theories?! It's canon
23/10/20, 2:57 pm - Supratik: Dragon Ball Z ta bhalo chilo super ta du ekta episode chara khub ekta hifi lageni
23/10/20, 2:58 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Boruto? Who's that? 🤔
23/10/20, 2:58 pm - Supratik: 🤣🤣
23/10/20, 2:58 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I know no such character
23/10/20, 2:58 pm - Supratik: Yeah I know I know you don't know that character
23/10/20, 2:59 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Last I remember Madara was stabbed by some black guy and then I don't really remember anything
23/10/20, 3:00 pm - Supratik: You don't even remember Kaguya getting sealed!?
23/10/20, 3:00 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Who's Kaguya?
23/10/20, 3:00 pm - Supratik: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
23/10/20, 3:01 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Madara is the last villain of Naruto and then I have nothing else to remember
23/10/20, 3:01 pm - Supratik: Yeah Kaguya was shown so weak
23/10/20, 3:01 pm - Supratik: Like they ended it in so hurry
23/10/20, 3:01 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: ...
23/10/20, 3:02 pm - Supratik: Like madara ke harate giye fete gelo infact parlou na harate and then Kaguya resurrected and boom 10 min e harie dilo WTF
23/10/20, 3:02 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Basically Naruto became Dragon Ball Z since that
23/10/20, 3:03 pm - Supratik: Don't compare them
23/10/20, 3:04 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yeah, they shouldn't be compared, but that's the problem, the ending made them comparable
23/10/20, 3:05 pm - Supratik: Ki bollam r ki bujlo 🙏
23/10/20, 3:07 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Simply put: fights in DBZ were mostly Power fights but in Naruto it was more Tactical Fights, in which you don't necessarily overpower your opponent, you oversmart them. But towards the end Naruto's fights became completely Power fights which made it lose its original epicness.
23/10/20, 3:08 pm - Supratik: But the character Naruto was based on power and emotions na
23/10/20, 3:08 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Based on power?¿ When?
23/10/20, 3:08 pm - Supratik: After infinite tsukyomi all they had to win with was power
23/10/20, 3:08 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yeah that's why it became lame
23/10/20, 3:08 pm - Supratik: 24 hr to Naruto nijei boltow I will be stronger than hokage stronger than hokage
23/10/20, 3:09 pm - Supratik: Naruto never used tactics the others around him specially shikamaru used to devise them
23/10/20, 3:13 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: But why did he say he wants to be stronger than Hokage? Is it because he liked being more powerful for the sake of it (like Goku)? No.
In original Naruto, the reason he wanted to become hokage was for getting acknowledgement and affiliation from his people around him who used to ignore him and despise him when he was a child.
In Shippuden, Naruto's main goal becomes bringing peace, and because of that he wanted to be powerful so that he can defeat any bad guys (but this ideology made him kinda lame in Shippuden)
23/10/20, 3:13 pm - Supratik: Otai tow bollam emotions and power
23/10/20, 3:14 pm - Supratik: He did whatever needed to be done
23/10/20, 3:14 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Naruto did. Think. First arc the Zabuza arc. Think, the Chunin exam arc both fights against Kiba and Neji.
23/10/20, 3:14 pm - Supratik: Yup shadow shurikens
23/10/20, 3:15 pm - Supratik: Orokom tactics dragon ball eo ache
23/10/20, 3:15 pm - Supratik: Infact Jiren ke oi bhabei defeat korechr
23/10/20, 3:15 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Naruto was dumb, but still he didn't defeat his opponents by transforming into ultra super Saiyan 2 Saiyan god super form and outpowering any of his opponents.
23/10/20, 3:16 pm - Supratik: Bhai kurama mode is same as being ssj
23/10/20, 3:16 pm - Supratik: How is it different
23/10/20, 3:16 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Exactly my point.
23/10/20, 3:16 pm - Supratik: Yeah so you need power
23/10/20, 3:16 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And then Kurama+Sage mode makes you SSJ God
23/10/20, 3:16 pm - Supratik: You don't expect someone as strong as madara to be defeated normally
23/10/20, 3:16 pm - Supratik: Yeah
23/10/20, 3:17 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And KuramaSage+Susanoo makes you SSJ Blue Vegito
23/10/20, 3:17 pm - Supratik: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
23/10/20, 3:17 pm - Supratik: Evabe tow bhebe dekhini
23/10/20, 3:17 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: This is why I said this
23/10/20, 3:19 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And the final nail in the coffin was declaring that Naruto and Sasuke were reincarnations of some Demi Gods, thus making them great by birth and their entire journey irrelevant.
23/10/20, 3:19 pm - Supratik: Hya ota Amaro boka boka legeche
23/10/20, 3:19 pm - Supratik: There was no need of that
23/10/20, 3:20 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: If they hadn't brought Kaguya and her sons into the picture, I would have still forgiven these comparisons.
23/10/20, 3:24 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Naruto never overpowered his enemies. His trump card was Talk no Jutsu, and it was great whenever he used it (except when he started using it so often that it became a meme)
23/10/20, 3:27 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Anyways, Naruto is in the past. I'm so hyped for _Demon Slayer: Mugen Train_ now 🤩

08/01/21, 8:34 pm - Sambit Aus: Aschi
08/01/21, 11:05 pm - Arunim Roy: Will u guys install whatsapp alternative or agree to new policy terms??
08/01/21, 11:11 pm - Supratik: What are the new terms?
08/01/21, 11:12 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: We basically agree with all those terms in facebook, instagram and messenger already
08/01/21, 11:19 pm - Arunim Roy: Dekhe ne na bhai
08/01/21, 11:20 pm - Arunim Roy: I know.. but ppl r kind of panicking over it.. I use Instagram.. and probably it does the same things like the new policy states
08/01/21, 11:33 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: As far as I have read, whatsapp won't  read your chats with people on your contacts, it will only read your chats with businesses, so that it can use that data for adverts on other platforms
08/01/21, 11:34 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I personally would suggest not connecting your whatsapp with any of the other platforms, so they can't really use your data because they don't know who you are outside of whatsapp
08/01/21, 11:42 pm - Arunim Roy: Which means? If I msg someone using Whatsapp for business.. that info will be  shared to third-party?
08/01/21, 11:43 pm - Arunim Roy: It's not my choice.. WhatsApp users have to agree to the new policy by 8th Feb else the app will stop functioning
08/01/21, 11:44 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Whatsapp by itself can't share it with third-party because WhatsApp's terms don't have that, but in fb and insta, we may have such terms to share data with third party. So if you connect whatsapp with fb or insta, then they can exploit this and share your whatsapp data from that
08/01/21, 11:45 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I know, I'm waiting anyway till Feb 8 to see if there's any major movement to telegraph or signal or anything else
08/01/21, 11:45 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: *telegram
08/01/21, 11:45 pm - Arunim Roy: Signal apparently crashed today after Elon musk's tweet
08/01/21, 11:46 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yeah I know XD
08/01/21, 11:46 pm - Arunim Roy: Same here.. I'm going to look at the patterns too
09/01/21, 12:06 am - Sambit Aus: Am I only one using all three things already?
09/01/21, 12:07 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: The point is to completely ditch the others (specifically whatsapp)
09/01/21, 11:33 am - Sambit Aus: I dont think we can completely ditch whatsapp at this point, we can only move our most private chats to different app and keep whatsapp as a business app sort of thing.
09/01/21, 11:33 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yup that's what I think as well
09/01/21, 11:49 am - Sambit Aus: Ummm, to send audio messages? Or call?
09/01/21, 11:49 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: For calls and voice messages?
09/01/21, 11:49 am - Sambit Aus: You can deny ofcourse
09/01/21, 11:50 am - Arunim Roy: Yeah.. I tried calling but that doesn't mean permission for recording right
09/01/21, 11:50 am - Arunim Roy: Ofcourse I will
09/01/21, 11:50 am - Arunim Roy: Will my call go through then?
09/01/21, 11:50 am - Sambit Aus: 🤦🏻‍♂️ Recording doesn't mean that kind of recording
09/01/21, 11:50 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: You know you already give this permission to whatsapp right?
09/01/21, 11:50 am - Arunim Roy: At that time I didn't realise probably
09/01/21, 11:51 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: "that kind of recording"....
09/01/21, 11:51 am - Sambit Aus: Exactly, not that kind
09/01/21, 11:51 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Definitely not that kind
09/01/21, 11:52 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Ok so I guess you will stop calling at all from now on
09/01/21, 11:52 am - Arunim Roy: Isn't it supposed to expressed in bit more clearer terms
09/01/21, 11:52 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: You should ask sambit for clarification
09/01/21, 11:53 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Your phone app also has that permission btw
09/01/21, 11:53 am - Arunim Roy: Not actually. I'm calling him right now..
09/01/21, 11:53 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And all your Google apps including YouTube also has that permission because of their voice search
09/01/21, 11:53 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Then your voice is being "recorded" by your phone app
09/01/21, 11:53 am - Arunim Roy: Point
09/01/21, 11:54 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Android has a notification on top if any app tries to record audio in the background
09/01/21, 11:55 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: That way you can monitor if any app is trying to spy on u
09/01/21, 11:55 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Btw I can understand why Arunim is so concerned about his voice recordings from the language of this message
09/01/21, 11:56 am - Arunim Roy: Why am I concerned? Pls shed some light
09/01/21, 11:56 am - Sambit Aus: True that

25/03/21, 11:29 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I know saw this yesterday
25/03/21, 11:29 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: But the trailer makes it look like we won't be able to control every move of the car
25/03/21, 11:30 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: It's gonna be like combo moves that automatically do flip resets
25/03/21, 11:34 pm - Sambit Aus: We don't know the controls yet, but lookd good for gaming while not at home
25/03/21, 11:35 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes I am saying this from looking at the trailer.
25/03/21, 11:36 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And if I'm right, it won't be true to its pc counterpart, but can still be fun for the casual players
25/03/21, 11:40 pm - Sambit Aus: Yea i mean it is 2D so, and being true to pc is not even gonna be fun in mobile, this is more like an advertisement for the main game
25/03/21, 11:41 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yeah I understand, it is mostly a marketting gimmick to bring more people in
25/03/21, 11:42 pm - Sambit Aus: It will definitely make it a lot popular in India
25/03/21, 11:43 pm - Sambit Aus: And then finally we can get RLCS here

26/03/21, 10:13 pm - Sambit Aus: https://youtu.be/H5MYRQa71rw
26/03/21, 10:14 pm - Sambit Aus: This means those were legit flip resets
26/03/21, 10:54 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: There is no concept of flip resets because there's no flip timer in this
26/03/21, 11:07 pm - Sambit Aus: There isnt6?
26/03/21, 11:09 pm - Sambit Aus: Still there is a lot of complex things that can be done
26/03/21, 11:37 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes it is better than I thought when I saw the trailer
26/03/21, 11:37 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: But it's way less complicated than its 3D counterpart
26/03/21, 11:38 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: There's no bumping, no recovery mechanics, no use ofair roll
26/03/21, 11:38 pm - Sambit Aus: Come on, that is obvious
26/03/21, 11:38 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes I know, just stating the obvious cuz I was not sure of it was obvious to you as well
26/03/21, 11:39 pm - Sambit Aus: Oh you think i am 1 iq
26/03/21, 11:39 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I don't know, I never measured 🤷🏻‍♂️
26/03/21, 11:40 pm - Sambit Aus: Yet you treated me like that
26/03/21, 11:41 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I would treat the same to Shikamaru if Asuma never told us his IQ score

Rum is indeed revealed to be Rumi, as evidenced by her call to her direct subordinate Whiskey, who is revealed to be Kanenori Wakita. A flashback is shown how Rumi instructed Wakita to go on behalf of her to pose as Rum during the meeting with Akai and Camel and also in the latest involvement to alter his voice and give Gin and the others the orders to retrieve Camel. The last page apparently shows her meeting Conan with the intention to kidnap him..mthings apparently escalated quickly 😶"

29/06/21, 3:55 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Democracy to
29/06/21, 3:55 pm - Sambit Aus: Absolutely
29/06/21, 3:56 pm - Saradindu: In a democracy everyone should get an equal share and equal opportunity
29/06/21, 3:57 pm - Saradindu: For sambit the opportunity to dine with us in Kalyani today itself is not definitely equal and so the treat won't happen today
29/06/21, 3:57 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes sambit er treat chaini to
29/06/21, 3:57 pm - Saradindu: 🤣🤣🤣
29/06/21, 3:57 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Tor ta de
29/06/21, 3:58 pm - Saradindu: But if I m treating I want to give everyone equal opportunity
29/06/21, 3:58 pm - Saradindu: I ain't Modi bhakt bro
29/06/21, 3:58 pm - Saradindu: So according to my morals sambit isn't getting equal share
29/06/21, 3:59 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Invite everyone, those who can come can have the treat. Shimple.
29/06/21, 3:59 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Who are you to judge people's opportunities
29/06/21, 3:59 pm - Saradindu: Mah life mah rules😎
29/06/21, 3:59 pm - Saradindu: Let's settle midway...
29/06/21, 3:59 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Cringe went infinity very quick
29/06/21, 4:00 pm - Saradindu: 😂😂😂

29/06/21, 4:01 pm - Saradindu: Dats ur way
29/06/21, 4:01 pm - Saradindu: Not my midway
29/06/21, 4:01 pm - Saradindu: My midway would be somewhere btwn Kalyani and KOl
29/06/21, 4:01 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Let others pitch their midways as well
29/06/21, 4:02 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Then we can come with a midmidway
29/06/21, 4:02 pm - Saradindu: So that everyone can travel to that spot with almost equal distances btwn their native places
29/06/21, 4:02 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: But that's unfair to the environment
29/06/21, 4:03 pm - Saradindu: Environment has long been neglected...let it be so for one more day
29/06/21, 4:03 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Karma will come back to pay you with the one day
29/06/21, 4:04 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Also isn't this the environment month
29/06/21, 4:05 pm - Saradindu: Idk...but I love karma...the fact that I can have fun today my way for which I will have to pay some other day is interesting...sounds like credit facility to me
29/06/21, 4:06 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: It seems very interesting until the other day comes
29/06/21, 4:08 pm - Saradindu: See by not getting out our respective houses for something as petty as a treat...seems like the best thing to do for the environment...so this way u won't have to pay up later too
29/06/21, 4:09 pm - Saradindu: Ofcrs if it was ur treat the it would be a different scenario...in that case I would be ready to pay up later
29/06/21, 4:12 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Then I would definitely not give the treat, cuz I don't want you to have to pay up later

19/08/21, 12:25 am - Sambit Aus: Yea we need the scapegoats
19/08/21, 12:25 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 😂
19/08/21, 6:20 am - Supratik: 😂
19/08/21, 10:01 am - Arunim Roy: NarutoVerse Doubt Alert... Just came upon something.. How is a normal Substitution jutsu too different from Sasuke's rinnegan ability to swap with things.. Except for the fact that living things are involved?.. Like honestly.. i found substitution to be the lamest excuse to avoid getting killed... but seriously.. it's something Kishimoto might have missed altogether..
19/08/21, 10:03 am - Supratik: The biggest difference between Rinnegan and Substitution I think is with Rinnegan swap you can fool the enemy . If you remember the fight with Madara Sasuke and Naruto distracts him by pointing their attacks towards each other and then Sasuke actually swaps Madara in between their attack giving him no time to attack
19/08/21, 10:04 am - Supratik: This technique is also used in later fights in Boruto as well to drag the enemy in between attacks apart from attacking them
19/08/21, 10:04 am - Supratik: Substitution can't do that
19/08/21, 10:06 am - Arunim Roy: yeah.. well I get that Rinnegan involves living beings whilst substitution cant do that.. but really Rinnegan is actually just a fancy substitution
19/08/21, 10:07 am - Supratik: It's a much more powered up substitution actually
19/08/21, 10:08 am - Arunim Roy: Also.. Another thing is that. abt the teleportation techinque used by Minato.. vs the one used by Obito and Kakashi.. How in hell.. does Obito transport himself.. to places he has never been before.. doesnt make any sense...
19/08/21, 10:08 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Substitution Jutsu was never properly explained as to how it exactly works
19/08/21, 10:08 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Where does the user go after he substitutes himself with an object?
19/08/21, 10:08 am - Arunim Roy: exactly.. like i said.. bad excuse for staying alive
19/08/21, 10:09 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yeah it was definitely an excuse jutsu
19/08/21, 10:09 am - Arunim Roy: @919051167186 how do you explain this?
19/08/21, 10:10 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Obito use a dimension to reduce the distance between places
19/08/21, 10:10 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: *uses
19/08/21, 10:11 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: So obito is actually traveling less distance
19/08/21, 10:11 am - Arunim Roy: Suffice to say that their teleportation was of a whole different level than minato's
19/08/21, 10:12 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes ofc
19/08/21, 10:12 am - Arunim Roy: Also.. I realised something.. after the four hokages were reanimated.. how the hell.. did they teleport themselves to the battlefield?
19/08/21, 10:12 am - Arunim Roy: there were no markings there
19/08/21, 10:12 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: They ran
19/08/21, 10:12 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: They literally ran
19/08/21, 10:13 am - Arunim Roy: Ummm.. no.. 2nd hokage does comment to the 4th that his flying raigin was superior to the one Tobirama developed.. They did use flying raigin
19/08/21, 10:13 am - Arunim Roy: exactly when they reached
19/08/21, 10:14 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I remember him saying he was impressed how 4th was faster than himself. I don't remember mention of flying raijin
19/08/21, 10:14 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I'm speaking on 6yrs old memory tho, so bear with me
19/08/21, 10:14 am - Arunim Roy: well.. i assumed he meant the jutsu..
19/08/21, 10:15 am - Arunim Roy: 😂Same here
19/08/21, 10:16 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Hotat kano egulo matha elo? @918870549218
19/08/21, 10:17 am - Arunim Roy: emni... shobh toh hothat i hoe amr saathe
19/08/21, 10:17 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 🤣
19/08/21, 10:20 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Rinnegan's power spectrum is so weird. It changes from time to time.  People rarely use things Pain used, and everyone develops something new, Madara had Limbo, Sasuke has Amenotejikara and I don't even follow what the Otsutsukis have now
19/08/21, 10:21 am - Supratik: Otsutsukis have "whatever the fuck I want will happen"
19/08/21, 10:21 am - Supratik: 😂
19/08/21, 10:21 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: And still lose to Boruto
19/08/21, 10:21 am - Supratik: Yes because he has "I will not let you have whatever the fuck you want"
19/08/21, 10:29 am - Sambit Aus: You guys are watching boruto?
19/08/21, 10:33 am - Supratik: No
19/08/21, 10:34 am - Sambit Aus: Oh thank god
19/08/21, 10:35 am - Arunim Roy: rarely a few episodes... apparently. the series has started following the manga.. I'm just interested in finding out how OP they make the next gen characters.. But honestly... Kishimoto must be crying at what they made it into
19/08/21, 10:36 am - Arunim Roy: Now naruto is persistently using the Nine tails chakra wherever he can.. It's almost laughable
19/08/21, 10:37 am - Arunim Roy: Some fight scenes r good
19/08/21, 10:38 am - Sambit Aus: Its DBZ all over again
19/08/21, 10:44 am - Arunim Roy: Well said bondhu.. accurate assessment in 4 words
19/08/21, 10:45 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I'm pretty sure it's five words
19/08/21, 10:45 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: @61405887022 I told you people can't count above 4
19/08/21, 10:45 am - Arunim Roy: i know... i just stated simply
19/08/21, 10:46 am - Arunim Roy: well... he should have spelt it correctly
19/08/21, 10:46 am - Arunim Roy: actually.. it is 8 words.. if I expand DBZ
19/08/21, 10:47 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: My point still holds
19/08/21, 10:49 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I had only watched one episode of the Naruto Sasuke vs some Otsutsuki fight at around episode 65, and it ended with Boruto doing a giant rasengan and defeating the enemy
19/08/21, 10:50 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I wasn't sure I was watching a DBZ themed Naruto episode or a Naruto themed DBZ epsiode
19/08/21, 11:02 am - Sambit Aus: Its only Arunim
19/08/21, 11:03 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 🤣🤣
19/08/21, 11:03 am - Sambit Aus: Both
19/08/21, 11:04 am - Souvik Jio: 😂😂
19/08/21, 11:06 am - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: This literally demonstrates my yesterday's hypothesis. Now I understand why God made Arunim remember Naruto today, the whole purpose was proving my point from yesterday's.
19/08/21, 12:02 pm - Sambit Aus: If they can't count above four, they shouldn't watch match, they should watch math
19/08/21, 12:02 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Wish people did what they should do
19/08/21, 12:21 pm - Sambit Aus: We should force them to

23/08/21, 9:35 pm - Supratik: Tobirama
23/08/21, 9:36 pm - Arunim Roy: He isn't my favourite without reason.. and I have told that to you..You guys simply don't agree
23/08/21, 9:36 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yeah I'm pretty sure it's his own dialogue

09/09/21, 1:37 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: 🤣🤣
09/09/21, 1:38 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: idk i mean i liked it n all... but 98%?! 🤨
09/09/21, 1:39 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: i'm pretty sure it's Disney's doing to make more hype
09/09/21, 1:39 pm - Sambit Aus: 😆 This is somehow better than captain America 2 they mean?
09/09/21, 1:39 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: just like they made Endgame beat Avatar by buying their own tickets 🤣🤣
09/09/21, 1:40 pm - Sambit Aus: 😆 Oh yea peak disney move
09/09/21, 1:40 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Cap2 and GoTG are the best ever MCU movies, I don't care ratings
09/09/21, 1:41 pm - Sambit Aus: I wouldn't those two on the same level, cap2 is definitely higher than gotg
09/09/21, 1:41 pm - Sambit Aus: Not saying gotg is bad or anything
09/09/21, 1:41 pm - Sambit Aus: Cap2 is just too good
09/09/21, 1:42 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I prefer GotG over Cap2 because of its "less darkness" and more "warmth", but I guess that would be the exact reason for you to have Cap 2 over GotG
09/09/21, 1:43 pm - Sambit Aus: Not entirely that, but part of the reason, sure
09/09/21, 1:43 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: anyways, ShangChi is not on either of those levels
09/09/21, 1:43 pm - Sambit Aus: 😆 Hell no
09/09/21, 1:44 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Maybe they could've come closer if they tried to keep to grounded instead of bringing all dragins n all
09/09/21, 1:44 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: *dragons
09/09/21, 1:45 pm - Sambit Aus: Shang chi has like 10 mins of good looking fights and a mildly interesting villian and thats about it.
09/09/21, 1:45 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: For marvel, that "mildly interesting villain" is quite a rare commodity
09/09/21, 1:46 pm - Sambit Aus: 😆 Oh yea, that's why people thought Thanos was cool
09/09/21, 1:47 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I dont even put Thanos under that category, especially after Endgame
09/09/21, 1:47 pm - Sambit Aus: Villian category?
09/09/21, 1:47 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: mildly interesting villain category
09/09/21, 1:47 pm - Sambit Aus: Oh yea
09/09/21, 1:48 pm - Sambit Aus: Mcu has had 2 good villians so far, Zemo, and Killmonger
09/09/21, 1:48 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: but Zemo was full of plotholes
09/09/21, 1:48 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: his backstory was better
09/09/21, 1:49 pm - Sambit Aus: Yea thats what i meant
09/09/21, 1:49 pm - Sambit Aus: Like motivation stuff
09/09/21, 1:49 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Yes
09/09/21, 1:50 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: How about He Who Remains? 😆
09/09/21, 1:50 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I mean he had some good points on why he does what he does
09/09/21, 1:50 pm - Sambit Aus: Need to see more, not enough info so far
09/09/21, 1:51 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: yes agree
09/09/21, 1:51 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: problem is variants can have different motivations
09/09/21, 1:51 pm - Sambit Aus: That is fine as long the personality is interesting
09/09/21, 1:52 pm - Sambit Aus: Unlike other mcu villains who are cardboard cutouts for heros to punch
09/09/21, 1:53 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I think Phase 4 villains have so far been more than cardboard cutouts

09/09/21, 2:06 pm - Sambit Aus: Yea, that's why, if you see two Chinese epic action movies you will understand how much of a rip off shang chi is
09/09/21, 2:07 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: Then it makes sense, they wanted to please the Chinese audience

@919051167186 You said if operating systems and apps were spying on us for ad data, someone would have found it out, well someone did. Pretty sure if you keep Wireshark records for daily usage you will find a lot more of these.
30/01/23, 3:22 pm - Abhishek Dutta Kalyani: I think I said it for if they are listening to our voices or cam feeds, but yeah this might also be a borderline privacy violation. Are they trying to build a case against MS? Such cases can cost a lot of money for these firms if found guilty.
